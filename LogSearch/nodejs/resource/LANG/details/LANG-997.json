It should differentiate between integers and floats and between encoded and consitent (decimal) encoding. And for the encoded form, it needs to spell out the syntax supported. For example \"0\" and \"0x\" and \"#\" for Integer.decode(). Integer.parseInt(\"012\") -> 12. Integer. Integer.decode(\"012\") -> 10. It also needs to support different value ranges.

I expected for this method the same behaviour you described at [LANG-992|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LANG-992?focusedCommentId=13949713&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13949713]:\n\n{quote}\nActually my expectation for using that method would be that \"isNumber returns true if I can use it without a NumberFormatException with Integer.parseInt(String) or Double.parseDouble(String)\"\n{quote}\n\nI expected that \"018\" was recognized as a valid number, because as it can be used as new Integer( \"018\" ), without any NFExceptions, it made sense to me that it was recognized as a valid Java number, hence isNumber( \"018\" ) should return true. Then went into LANG-971 issue link and and saw that this is not the method intention. I found it a bit surprising.\n\nWe've been using this method to check if some fixed-width values were \"numbers\" or not (as in behaviour described on the quote above), and when upgrading suddenly a lot of tests began to fail because of this change. Seems we'll have to seek for a workaround if we want to upgrade this library. It'd be fine for me if at least the javadocs would give a more precise description regarding the scope of the method or, maybe some examples of the method outcomes on the method's javadoc (as it's done on StringUtils, f.ex).\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=juanpablo","name":"juanpablo","key":"juanpablo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=juanpablo&avatarId=24562","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=juanpablo&avatarId=24562","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=juanpablo&avatarId=24562","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=juanpablo&avatarId=24562"},"displayName":"Juan Pablo Santos Rodríguez","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-04-28T23:10:26.164+0000","updated":"2014-04-28T23:10:26.164+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12709554/comment/13991149","id":"13991149","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dmjones500","name":"dmjones500","key":"dmjones500","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dmjones500&avatarId=31601","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dmjones500&avatarId=31601","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dmjones500&avatarId=31601","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dmjones500&avatarId=31601"},"displayName":"Duncan Jones","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"[~juanpablo]: have you considered {{isDigits()}}?\n\nI've also updated the Javadoc to better describe octal handling:\n\nbq.
