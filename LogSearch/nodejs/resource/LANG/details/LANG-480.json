I don't like the idea of building in the reflection stuff.  We get no compiler checking that way and it leads to unreadable code.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jwcarman","name":"jwcarman","key":"jwcarman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"James Carman","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-01-22T14:18:51.375+0000","updated":"2009-01-22T14:18:51.375+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12412851/comment/12666155","id":"12666155","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=capitol","name":"capitol","key":"capitol","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Kjäll","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Amsterdam"},"body":"Just my 2 cents, I don't need a release that fixes this bug, i stumbled on it by chance and wrote a patch so that the next person that have the same problem that i do won't have to dig through the library in order to understand what's going on.\n\nI'm mainly interested in fixing this because i don't like buggy software, but i totally agree that building in reflection stuff leads to more problems than it solves in the long run.\n\nMy opinion on how to fix this is either push for the JDK 1.5 dependency, or write some code that parses the format the strings are stored in memory.
