Let me clarify:\n\n- Restoring accessibility in {{readField(Object, String, boolean)}} and {{writeField(Object, String, Object, boolean)}} is necessary, because getField() gets called in these two methods. getField() may change the accessibility of the field. Since getField() guarantees, according to its javadoc, to return \"an accessible {@link Field} by name\" it was not an option to restore the accessibility within this method. Therefore it needs to be restored in the above mentioned read/write methods separately.\n\n- The original tests failed after the \"accessibility leak\" has been fixed. In the corresponding assert statement the field was filled with an expected value for assertion although it might not be accessible. Before, they only succeeded because of the leak. You can reproduce this by applying the patch for the FieldUtil class and use the original tests. So the changes to the tests do not test the restoring of the accessibility, they just guarantee, that the tests work like before.\n\nLet me know, if any uncertainty remains.\n\nBR\nAndré","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andd","name":"andd","key":"andd","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andre Diermann","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-08-23T13:27:05.503+0000","updated":"2014-08-23T13:27:05.503+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12692726/comment/14110652","id":"14110652","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=britter","name":"britter","key":"britter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=britter&avatarId=18287","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=britter&avatarId=18287","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=britter&avatarId=18287","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=britter&avatarId=18287"},"displayName":"Benedikt Ritter","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Hello André,\n\nbq.

Maybe we should add a comment in JavaDoc, that users have to take care of restoring accessibility when using getField()...\n\nYes, adding a comment in the corresponding JavaDoc is a good idea and will raise the attention for a potential \"accessibility leak\" a bit more. Should I change the JavaDoc accordingly as part of this issue or should this be a dedicated issue and patch?\n\nbq. However I think it would be better to use FieldUtils.readField() to check if the field has been set correctly and to assert that the field is not accessible after the call to writeField(). WDYT?\n\nI think the author of the original test code wanted to use \"pure\" Java for the assertion. The correct behavior of {{Field.get()}} is guaranteed by the JDK while {{FieldUtils.readField()}} is not (since this method is tested in the same test class and execution order of jUnit tests might be random). So from my understanding the avoidance of a method of the class under test to test another method within the class under test is on purpose. So my intention here was really to use the minimum amount of changes to the original code to keep the tests green and this one-liner was the shortest solution.\n\nMaybe this is a smell that tests for the correct restoring of the accessibility is missing? O:) I will add further tests to assert that accessibility is restored correctly. This should not be tested implicitly within the {{testWrite…()}}. Ok?\n\nbq. 1. missing curly brackets ;-) We use curly brackets even for one line blocks.\n\nSorry, you are write. I will change this.\n\nbq. 2. I'm not sure whether {{!Modifier.isPublic(field.getModifiers()))}} really is the same as {{Field.isAccessible() == false}}. Reading through the JavaDoc of {{Field.setAccessible(boolean)}} sounds like it is a difference. But I don't know. It think it would be better to get the field via {{getField(cls, fieldName, false)}}, store the accessibility, do all neccessary operations and then restore the original state. This way you only need to restore the accessibility once.\n\nThe reason for the usage of {{Modifier.isPublic()}} is the used workaround for JDK 1.3 in {{getField()}} (see line 107). The accessibility of the field is only set to true, when forceAccess is true and the modifier is public. That’s why I need to check both before evantually restoring accessibility to false. But I totally agree with you, that it looks confusing. I don’t know if we can solve this without jeopardizing the workaround.\n\nSorry if the patch is that confusing, but I really spent a lot of time to understand the original code and then tried to use a minimum amount of changes to fix issue #965.

The reason for the usage of Modifier.isPublic() is the used workaround for JDK 1.3 in getField() (see line 107).\n\nI'm not sure I've mae myself clear enough. I'll try to explain better :-) My critique is, that the code for restoring accessibility is duplicated, although the one {{writeField()}} calls the other. So the idea is use {{getField}} with forceAccess = false to retrieve the field. This will return the field, even if it is not accessible.
