For integer ranges, (a,b) is no different from [a+1, b-1] --\ni.e., being able to specify \"inclusivity\" does not really buy you anything other\nthan convenience (at the expense of a more complicated API and some overhead). \nFor floating point ranges, counting on the difference between (a,b) and [a,b]\nwould in most cases I can imagine be dangerous -- so here again, the extension\ndoes not really buy you anything.  \n\nI may of course be missing some important and valuable use cases, in which case\nI will happily move to +0 once I know what they are.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phil%40steitz.com","name":"phil@steitz.com","key":"phil@steitz.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Phil Steitz","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2004-06-27T13:35:13.000+0000","updated":"2004-06-27T13:35:13.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12341030/comment/12405269","id":"12405269","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tobrien%40discursive.com","name":"tobrien@discursive.com","key":"tobrien@discursive.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tim O'Brien","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I've marked this as WONTFIX.
