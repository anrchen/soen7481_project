It would have been much better if the implementation consistently stuck the idea of incrementing by 1 for each match. This would not rule out the optimization because one would simply return n for the empty search string case.\n    \n    Given the situation I guess it's not an option to change the implementation though, so the only option left is to adjust the documentation to reflect the current behavior. Here are two suggestions:\n    \n    \"increments by 1 unless the search string is the empty string in which case the position is never incremented\"\n    \n    or something like\n    \n    \"always
