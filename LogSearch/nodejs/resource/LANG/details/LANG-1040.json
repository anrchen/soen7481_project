Thus the string 09 will return false, since 9 is not a valid octal value. However, numbers beginning with 0. are treated as decimal.\n\nNull and empty String will return false.{quote}\n\nIn other Jira issues, I've seen people suggest that a number if valid if it can be used when assigning to a suitable Java type.
