StringUtils.ordinalIndexOf(\"aaaaaa\", \"aa\", 2) == 1 would be true because the sequence 'aa' is at every index. There seems to be confusion around this method, but it seems to me the original code had it correct.\n\n{code:java}\nint index = lastIndex ? str.length() : INDEX_NOT_FOUND;\n\ndo {\n\nif (lastIndex) {\n\nindex = CharSequenceUtils.lastIndexOf(str, searchStr, index - 1);\n\n} else {\n\nindex = CharSequenceUtils.indexOf(str, searchStr, index + 1);\n\n}\n{code}\n\nI'm not sure why StringUtils.ordinalIndexOf(\"aaaaaa\", \"aa\", 2) == 3 would ever be true.\nStringUtils.ordinalIndexOf(\"aaaaaa\", \"aa\", 2) == 2 is easier to see where it's coming from, but StringUtils.ordinalIndexOf(\"aaaaaa\", \"aa\", 2) == 1 is still the correct answer, and it also works for other tests. I found my way here because I wanted to use this method in a project, but found that the current release is broken by commit [e5a3039|https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/commit/e5a3039f7a1e727fca40db7357a9191b6a7cf41d] . With the current release if the first index is between 0 and searchStr.length() -1 the method will return the index for ordinal + 1.....in other words the wrong index.\n\nThis fact is missed in a test like\nassertEquals(3, StringUtils.ordinalIndexOf(\"aaaaaa\", \"aa\", 2));\n/* Note the above test from commit [e5a3039|https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/commit/e5a3039f7a1e727fca40db7357a9191b6a7cf41d] is incorrect since the array of chars begins at 0.*/\n\nThe following test should pass, but will fail in the current release due to the broken method:\n{code:java}\nassertEquals(0, StringUtils.ordinalIndexOf(\"abaabaab\", \"ab\", 1);\nassertEquals(3, StringUtils.ordinalIndexOf(\"abaabaab\", \"ab\", 2);\nassertEquals(6, StringUtils.ordinalIndexOf(\"abaabaab\", \"ab\", 3);\n{code}\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"StringUtils.ordinalIndexOf broken","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pascalschumacher","name":"pascalschumacher","key":"pascalschumacher","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pascal Schumacher","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pascalschumacher","name":"pascalschumacher","key":"pascalschumacher","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pascal Schumacher","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12973809/comment/15323924","id":"15323924","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nmanley","name":"nmanley","key":"nmanley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nick Manley","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"[~sebb@apache.org]'s commit [d75fe46|https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/commit/d75fe46b8f1b0d5c27887052ee4714d6a9c7ea4b] reverts LANG-1077 which was closed as invalid.
