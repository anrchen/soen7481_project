This is a regression against commons-lang 2.x.\n\nBasically, when the \"forced time zone\" code was removed, the TimeZoneNameRule class stopped respecting the Calendar instance's timezone, and instead now always uses the mTimeZone of the FastDateFormat instance itself (which is only supposed to be used when formatting timezone-less objects such as Date or long).\n\nThe removal of the forced time zone stuff is surely the right thing to do (it was a mess).  I think the fix is to change the TimeZoneNameRule inner class to not take a TimeZone instance, but rather to use the TimeZone on the Calendar instance passed into appendTo(), just like TimeZoneNumberRule does.  Presumably then for efficiency, one would use the getTimeZoneDisplay() package-static method to quickly retrieve the required timezone's display name.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12545424","id":"12545424","filename":"commons-lang3-LANG-818.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dmjones500","name":"dmjones500","key":"dmjones500","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dmjones500&avatarId=31601","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dmjones500&avatarId=31601","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dmjones500&avatarId=31601","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dmjones500&avatarId=31601"},"displayName":"Duncan Jones","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2012-09-17T14:54:18.981+0000","size":3776,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12545424/commons-lang3-LANG-818.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"74627","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"FastDateFormat's \"z\" pattern does not respect timezone of Calendar instances passed to format()","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dcollens","name":"dcollens","key":"dcollens","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dan Collens","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dcollens","name":"dcollens","key":"dcollens","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dan Collens","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12606449/comment/13456987","id":"13456987","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dmjones500","name":"dmjones500","key":"dmjones500","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dmjones500&avatarId=31601","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dmjones500&avatarId=31601","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dmjones500&avatarId=31601","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dmjones500&avatarId=31601"},"displayName":"Duncan Jones","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"I've attached a patch that I believe addresses this issue, plus a unit test to prove correctness.\n\nThe only minor issue is that the estimated length provided by TimeZoneNameRule.estimateLength() is now based on the wrong timezone.
