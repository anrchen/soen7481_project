Prior to 2.4, this was not the case.  This is caused by the patch in LANG-363, which changed the behavior of StringEscapeUtils.escapeJavaScript(String str) to escape forward-slashes for compatibliity with IE.  The change was implemented in code common to both methods; StringEscapeUtils.escapeJavaStyleString() .\n\nThis side-effect change to StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava() is a problem in my project.  I don't see any reason why it is necessary to escape forward-slashes in escapeJava(), so I suggest the behavior be changed so that escapeJavaScript() escapes forward-slashes, but escapeJava() does not.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12379940","id":"12379940","filename":"patch.diff","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mhurne","name":"mhurne","key":"mhurne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mhurne&avatarId=18430","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mhurne&avatarId=18430","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mhurne&avatarId=18430","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mhurne&avatarId=18430"},"displayName":"Matt Hurne","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2008-04-11T17:45:50.672+0000","size":4356,"mimeType":"text/x-patch","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12379940/patch.diff"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"74755","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"StringEscapeUtils.escapeJava() behavior changed;
