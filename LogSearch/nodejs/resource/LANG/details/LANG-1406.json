object with three char which are [ i,  ̇, x] instead of [ İ, x].\r\n\r\nSo by given a incorrect result from .toLowCase() method, StringUtils.replaceIgnoreCase end attempt to access the segment of string which is not exist which is 3 in this case while str.length() is 2.\r\n\r\nThe fixture I come up with is replacing the .toLowcase() to .toUpperCase() in order to avoid the mis-interprettion on

So the first visible character we see is the [\"Latin Capital Letter I with Dot Above\"](https://unicode-table.com/en/#0130) (see also [this other link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotted_and_dotless_I)), and the second an `x`. And doing `toUpperCase()` simply won't change it as it's considered already upper case.\r\n    \r\n    When doing a `toLowerCase`, it gets translated into two visible characters. The second is the normal `x`. While the first contains two codepoints. I tested in Python, and got the lower case `i` (`print(u\"\\u0069\")`) followed by a character invisible by itself (`print (u\"\\u0307\")`).\r\n    \r\n    The special/invisible character, is visible when coming after certain letters.\r\n    \r\n    ```python\r\n    >>> print(u\"\\u0307\")\r\n    \r\n    >>> print(u\"\\u0069\\u0307\")\r\n    i̇\r\n    >>> print(u\"\\u0068\\u0307\")\r\n    ḣ\r\n    >>> print(u\"\\u0067\\u0307\")\r\n    ġ\r\n    >>> print(u\"\\u0067\\u0307\")\r\n    ```\r\n    \r\n    When we get these invisible characters, as we have one code point more, the length returned is not 2, but 3. Resulting in exception in this issue.\r\n    \r\n    I don't believe the fix here would fix the reverse case, where we had a lower case, single codepoint, unicode; that would be represented by a two code codepoint. The exception could happen again (I haven't investigated whether such case exist, but I'm assuming there could be such case - if not now, maybe a character could still be added in future editions).\r\n    \r\n    What do you think @HiuKwok ? Any suggestions? I'm not sure if there's any easy way to fix this case, except by adding a note to the documentation saying that the method is not intended to be used with unicode strings, as it doesn't handle supplementary characters well. Or maybe we could try to remove the `length()` call around the `StringBuilder`'s near the end of the method...\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2018-08-09T08:45:56.514+0000","updated":"2018-08-09T08:45:56.514+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13176106/comment/16574494","id":"16574494","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user kinow commented on a diff in the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/pull/340#discussion_r208851249\n  \n    --- Diff: src/main/java/org/apache/commons/lang3/StringUtils.java ---\n    @@ -5596,8 +5596,8 @@ private static String replace(final String text, String searchString, final Stri\n              }\n              String searchText = text;\n              if (ignoreCase) {\n    -             searchText = text.toLowerCase();\n    -             searchString = searchString.toLowerCase();\n    +             searchText = text.toUpperCase();\n    +             searchString = searchString.toUpperCase();\n    --- End diff --\n    \n    Just leaving a comment here too to have a review here in GitHub.

In order to achieve ignore case replacement, the internal logic would first transform both `text` and `SearchString` to lowerCase( ) for comparaition.   \r\n    \r\n    - However if anyone passion enough to digger deeper into the src logic of `.toLowerCase( )`. Certain unicode character would be denormalized. In this way the result String length would tend to longer than original length().  Example like:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37996731/45103213-efec8780-b161-11e8-8370-88a7edacfc42.png)\r\n    So making use of the transformed String, Out bound exception would happen when trying to access the index that doesn't access at all (3 in this case vs 2 in length before lowerCase).\r\n    \r\n    Flow:\r\n    \r\n     - So the first thought into my mind is, why dun just normalize both `text` and `searchString` before performing ignore case comparation? In this way the String length would always stay consistence no matter `toLowerCase( )` or `toUpperCase( )` 3 -> 3.  However the another problem would emerged, as you may noticed, while the String mentioned above denormalize, it would turn into a UpperCase I and a dot sign. \r\n    \r\n    - But what happen if the search pattern emerge into searchText in decompose form. In this case let say I am trying to match a upper [I]. Then mismatch would happen and this is certain not the desire behavior of this method I believe. \r\n    \r\n    BTW I Drafted a simple main method to demonstrate how mismatch would happen in here.\r\n    \r\n    https://github.com/HiuKwok/commons-lang/blob/master/src/main/java/com/hiukwok/test.java#L10-L20\r\n    \r\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2018-09-05T15:32:50.074+0000","updated":"2018-09-05T15:32:50.074+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13176106/comment/16604694","id":"16604694","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=michaelryan","name":"michaelryan","key":"michaelryan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Ryan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I've been thinking - how do case-insensitive regular expressions handle this?

The Character class produces a single character.\r\n\r\nSo I think a possible naive solution to this would be to call Character.toLowerCase() on each character in the String and then append the characters together into a new String.\r\n{code}\r\nString text = \"foo\";\r\nchar[] chars = text.toCharArray();\r\nfor (int i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {\r\n    chars[i] = Character.toLowerCase(chars[i]);\r\n}\r\nString lowerText = new String(chars);\r\n{code}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=michaelryan","name":"michaelryan","key":"michaelryan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Ryan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2018-09-05T17:19:12.648+0000","updated":"2018-09-05T17:30:39.539+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13176106/comment/16604916","id":"16604916","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user kinow commented on the issue:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/pull/340\n  \n    Good progress so far @HiuKwok .
