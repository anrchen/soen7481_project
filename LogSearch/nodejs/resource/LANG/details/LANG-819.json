Hopefully this will help, if you forgive the background:\n\nThere's an almost-requirement in C/C++ (auto_ptr aside) that a data structure have an \"owner\" and a number of referrents. The same happens in Java as good style, rather than requirement-to-avoid-leak. A complex class may own a Set<E>. The getter of this set may be typed Set<? extends E>. This tells any other person who takes that reference that they should not (and can not, due to compile failure) modify that set. On the other hand, if it's a factory method, the method may be typed Set<E>. This tells the person who takes the reference that they may (and can) modify that set, as they are now the primary (usually exclusive) owner of it. This Set<E> type generally comes with the assumption that unsynchronized mutation of the set is also permitted, modifying it will not break the encapsulation of the provider, and it isn't shared with any other threads. Yes, there are loopholes in this, but it's pretty good, vastly improves the ability of the compiler to show code correct, and reduces programmer mistakes (unnecessary copies, accidental modifications, etc).\n\nIt isn't really a surprise to anyone who has coded in Erlang or any monad-based language that it's actually relatively easy to write Java code where the majority of structures are never mutated after construction. Some languages have this as a restriction, but it turns out to be a fairly good idea even in Java: Most sensible ways to pass values between threads create a happen-before relationship in the JMM, and remembering that final variables have a happen-before relationship with the end of a constructor (something explicitly NOT true for nonfinal variables - not nearly enough people know this), this also makes it much easier to write highly threaded code correctly.  The vast majority of instance variables can be final, and modern IDEs tend to provide this as a default hint if they detect non-mutation, so this really is hitting mainstream. By this set of practices we get a applications where the majority of Collections are typed ? extends, the majority of variables are final, etc, etc.\n\nAnyway, this is all a suite of techniques for creating compile-time checked, reliable, threaded, idiot-developer-safe Java code.\n\nAt this point, it isn't about whether EnumUtils will modify the set. I know it won't. It's the fact that the code that CALLED EnumUtils only ever had a Collection<? extends E> in the first place, because the _actual_ owner of the collection, several calls back, decided to export it only as readonly.\n\nThe Guava library (which I mostly use these days) is very well written with respect to all these techniques, and applies them universally. See http://docs.guava-libraries.googlecode.com/git/javadoc/index.html?com/google/common/collect/Iterables.html - which shows how Guava handles iterables. The type within the Iterable is irrelevant. The point is, the caller of Iterables (and even back several frames from there) only had a Set<? extends> or a Collection<? extends> and the CALLER would have to upcast it in order to call EnumUtils with the current prototype.\n\nSo, you see, it isn't about a tiny religious issue about whether I like the current prototype or not. It's that in any code written with these good coding practices, I CAN'T call EnumUtils without upcasting the Set<? extends E> to a Set<E> in the previous frame, and if I upcast, my code won't pass review. If I use a raw type, my code won't pass review. There is NO WAY in which I can call this function and get code past review. I CAN NOT USE MUCH OF COMMONS. Guava, on the other hand, uses ? extends in every case where it's legal to do so, and can always be called from well-written type-safe code, and has consequently become the go-to library of choice. (That's also why this ticket languished for a year: we also ported away from commons to guava. But I did come back to try to help.)\n\nBootnote on Guava: It's Google's policy not to include any routine for which it does not have an internal customer. Apache does not have the same policy. In a recent experience, I submitted correct code and patches to Apache, with test suites, only to have the Apache authors fix up the original broken code to (just) pass the cases in my test suites, but still contain bugs because they fundamentally aren't internal customers for it and don't use it in anger or in generality. So it remains broken in Apache. My last experience with that was type (reflection) manipulation routines - my job is writing compilers, so I'm very hot on them, and familiarity breeds ease of spotting bugs, especially in type systems. But I won't play whack-a-mole submitting test suites to ASF when I have working code anyway. I'll just use my code. So there's some additional background to my frustration with ASF maintainers. While Google publish smaller libraries, the quality is unquestionably much higher because of this policy of (colloquially) \"If we can't dogfood it, we won't even publish it.\" They are also 100% familiar with the techniques I described in this comment, and reading any of their libraries in C++ or Java is an education in high-performance compile-time-checked coding. Of course what they don't do is put JSR305 annotations on their public APIs. I wish they did. I wish Apache would use JSR305, too.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arren","name":"arren","key":"arren","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shevek","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-10T09:20:28.549+0000","updated":"2014-01-10T09:22:38.636+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12606786/comment/13867789","id":"13867789","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tn","name":"tn","key":"tn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Neidhart","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"The idea of using <? extends X> collections to prevent modification by compile-time checks is new to me I have to admit.
