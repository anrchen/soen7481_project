If you use only one enum class, the bug won't be seen. If you use two enum classes, but statically reference them so that both classes are initialized before getEnum() is called, no bug. If you use two classes, or ten classes, or 10000 classes, but fail to overlap the threads reading the map and writing the map in just the right (or wrong) way, no bug.\n\nUnit testing isn't a great approach for testing synchronization problems since it's impossible for the test to control the execution order, especially when the bug requires actual concurrency.
