However, the fix is not 100% backwards compatible with the currently released commons-lang 3.4. To fix the loss of precision, values that were previously returning Floats are now returning Doubles. Some explicit casts may break as a result.\n    \n    ```java\n    // Works in 3.4, but causes ClassCastException in patch.\n    Float f = (Float) NumberUtils.createNumber(\"-160952.54\");\n    System.out.println(f); // prints \"-160952.55\"\n    \n    // Works with patch.\n    Double d = (Double) NumberUtils.createNumber(\"-160952.54\");\n    System.out.println(d); // prints \"-160952.54\"\n    ```\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/NickManley/commons-lang LANG-1018\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/pull/156.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #156\n    \n----\ncommit b77db22614da6f0c674b57cd0086048b58b30135\nAuthor: Nick Manley <nickmanley89@outlook.com>\nDate:   2016-05-24T09:10:29Z\n\n    LANG-1018: Fix precision loss on NumberUtils.createNumber(String)\n\n----\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-05-24T09:29:10.326+0000","updated":"2016-05-24T09:29:10.326+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12716767/comment/15316718","id":"15316718","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pascalschumacher","name":"pascalschumacher","key":"pascalschumacher","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pascal Schumacher","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"@everybody: Any opinions on the pull request?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pascalschumacher","name":"pascalschumacher","key":"pascalschumacher","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pascal Schumacher","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2016-06-06T16:25:42.248+0000","updated":"2016-06-06T16:25:42.248+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12716767/comment/15316755","id":"15316755","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sebb%40apache.org","name":"sebb@apache.org","key":"sebb@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sebb","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/GMT"},"body":"The calls to createDouble and createBigDecimal could be pushed down into the conditionals so they are only done if necessary.\nOtherwise looks OK.\n\nAlso, I wonder about the allZeros checks -
