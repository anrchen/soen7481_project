This causes ClassNotFoundException errors when using SerializationUtils.clone() because Java serialization uses the classloader of the current class (class invoked from) when doing serialization.  Java serialization does not respond to the thread context classloader.\n\nFix: The following web page suggests a fix (including the full source code) that honors the context classloader if set.  I don't know if this is the ideal solution, but at least it allows the problem to be worked around without affecting working behavior for existing clients.\nhttp://www.mail-archive.com/commons-dev@jakarta.apache.org/msg44524.html\n\nWorkaround: There is a flag to set on weblogic that inverts the classloader.  *HOWEVER*, this only works if the webapp does not need certain xml jars.   Otherwise, WebLogic will fail to start because *it* has classloader issues.    Therefore, this is not an acceptable workaround.  \n\nAnother workaround: The only workaround I know of is to copy the SerializationUtils class into a different package in my app so that the proper invocation context will be used for serialization.  This is very undesirable.\n\nI found these 3 bugs in the database that all seem to be the same problem.  \nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/OJB-140\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LANG-241\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JS2-831\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12473774","id":"12473774","filename":"ClassLoaderAwareCloneMethod.zip","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sludwig","name":"sludwig","key":"sludwig","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sven Ludwig","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-03-16T10:29:56.480+0000","size":1998,"mimeType":"application/zip","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12473774/ClassLoaderAwareCloneMethod.zip"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12448868","id":"12448868","filename":"ContextClassLoaderAwareCloneMethod.zip","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sludwig","name":"sludwig","key":"sludwig","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sven Ludwig","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-07-07T08:59:18.465+0000","size":3175,"mimeType":"application/zip","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12448868/ContextClassLoaderAwareCloneMethod.zip"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"74698","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"object cloning with SerializationUtils has classloader problems with no workaround","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ernestp","name":"ernestp","key":"ernestp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ernest Pasour","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ernestp","name":"ernestp","key":"ernestp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ernest Pasour","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"WebLogic 10.3","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12467372/comment/12881099","id":"12881099","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bayard","name":"bayard","key":"bayard","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Henri Yandell","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"mail-archive isn't working for me right now; I'm guessing it's this thread from 2004:\n\nhttp://commons.markmail.org/thread/trfdrjeb6qohru7p\n\nThe right solution, imo, is for Weblogic to do what all containers do/should do and use a package name rewrite at build time so they have their dependencies in private space.

WebLogic: I assume folks using it have a support contract and since this is a clear bug I'd recommend using your support contract to pressure Oracle into a fix. Yes it takes time and requires generally making a nuisance of yourself but it can be done - at least I got a handful of Oracle app server bugs fixed that way.\n\nw.r.t. Tomcat: if commons-lang is on the common class path it is because the user put it there. Tomcat does not use and does not ship with commons-lang and to the best of my recollection never has. The correct solution in this case is to put commons-lang where it belongs - in WEB-INF/lib. This would also work for any spec compliant servlet container.\n\nIn terms of the original proposed patch, I am not a fan of configuration via system properties unless there is no other choice. I'm not convinced that is the case here. I would also recommend testing to ensure that this patch does not trigger a class-loader memory leak. It shouldn't, but based on past experience I wouldn't be surprised if it did. Assuming no memory leak, the only remaining argument against the patch is one of bloat. Should we add code to commons-lang just to work around another product's bugs?
