However, this shouldn't cause the translator to crash.\n\n\nAt line 94, the loop which generates the exception increments the position by the size of the codepoint, which seems to grow faster than the number of characters. I don't really know how codepoints work, but it looks to me like there are two indexes which are treated as if they are the same one by this loop:\n\n * pt is incrementing by one character each iteration\n * pos is incrementing by one or more characters each iteration\n * pos is being used to index into the character array\n * pt is the value actually being tested in the loop test, so pos can be bigger than pt, causing an index problem at the end of the array\n\n\nMy guess would be that the loop should read something like:\n\n{code}\n            for (int pt = 0; pt < consumed;) {\n                int count = Character.charCount(Character.codePointAt(input, pos));\n                pt += count;\n                pos += count;\n            }\n{code}\n\nI'm not sure if that was the intention, hope it makes some sense!\n\nStepping through that code with the input string \" \\ud83d\\udc4d\":\n* the input string becomes \" \\ud83d\\udc4d\\u008d\" (appended 'Reverse Line Feed' - no idea why)\n* consumed == 4\n* Iterating the loop gives pt=0, pos=0 -> pt=1, pos=1 -> pt=2, pos=3 -> pt-3, pos=4 (Index exception)\n\nSo \\ud83d\\udc4d seems to be a codepoint with a width of 2, which puts the index off by one after that.\n\nAnyway, hope that helps,\n\nRegards,\nMike.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"234204","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"CharSequenceTranslator causes StringIndexOutOfBoundsException during translation of unicode codepoints with length > 1 character","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kothar","name":"kothar","key":"kothar","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Houston","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kothar","name":"kothar","key":"kothar","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Houston","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"OS X, Java 1.6","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12623131/comment/13527896","id":"13527896","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kothar","name":"kothar","key":"kothar","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Houston","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Apologies, I see this is fixed in the latests SVN - should have browsed the source code first!
