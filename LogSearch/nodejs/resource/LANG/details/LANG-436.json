However, the map is filled with MethodDescriptor instances, which are created in the same method as where they are put as keys in the map.

Better then IMO to just provide the reflection functionality here without the caching which is much cleaner.\n\nI have done some work on the memory leak associated with the WeakHashMap (nothing to do with the lack of synchronization - which I agree is another issue, thanks for reporting it) and problem seems to be caused by the Method reference held in the MethodDescriptor - see BEANUTILS-291 and http://tinyurl.com/5ksjrh which seems to fix this.\n\nThe BEANUTILS-291 memory leak issues is still on my todo list - but its currently in a broken state - with the same kind of issue as BEANUTILS-318, caused by me replacing the FastHashMap with WeakHashMap.
