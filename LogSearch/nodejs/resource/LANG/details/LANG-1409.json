Runtime exceptions may occur either because\r\n # an API lacks sufficient documentation,or\r\n # usage of the API does not conform to the specification, or\r\n # API wrapper does not indicate the API specification as part of its own specification.\r\n\r\nThe prototype then automatically generates test cases which show how such exceptions may be triggered.\r\n\r\n*Observation:*\r\n\r\nFor {{commons-lang}}, {{JDK APIs}} were analyzed. It seems that the failing methods do not handle the potential runtime exceptions which may or may not have been declared/documented for the JDK APIs they invoke.\r\n\r\n*Possible fixes:*\r\n # The failing methods under test could add internal checks on the values they forward to the {{JDK APIs}}.\r\n # The failing methods could handle the exceptions by adding relevant try/catch blocks.\r\n # The failing methods under test could specify the potential exceptions by adding {{@throws}} in their documentation/method signatures.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12935039","id":"12935039","filename":"CharSequenceUtilsTests.java","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Mozhan","name":"Mozhan","key":"mozhan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mozhan Soltani","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2018-08-09T20:44:01.137+0000","size":1062,"mimeType":"text/x-java-source","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12935039/CharSequenceUtilsTests.java"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12935040","id":"12935040","filename":"StringUtilsTests.java","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Mozhan","name":"Mozhan","key":"mozhan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mozhan Soltani","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2018-08-09T20:43:57.414+0000","size":2516,"mimeType":"text/x-java-source","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12935040/StringUtilsTests.java"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Crashes when testing StringUtils and CharSequenceUtils","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Mozhan","name":"Mozhan","key":"mozhan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mozhan Soltani","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Mozhan","name":"Mozhan","key":"mozhan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mozhan Soltani","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS, and McOs High Sierra-10.13.5 \r\n Junit-4.12","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/LANG-1409/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3wwm7:"}}
