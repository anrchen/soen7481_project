Yet the current implementation (and, it would appear, all implementations since its creation) of {{DateUtils.ceiling}} push a value exactly on its ceiling to the next value.\n\nObserve what happens if the following tests are added to {{DateUtilsTest.testCeil()}}:\n\n{code:java}\n         double double4 = 15.0;\n         assertEquals(\"ceiling double-4 failed\",\n         \t\tdouble4,\n         \t\tMath.ceil(double4));\n         \n         Date date4 = dateTimeParser.parse(\"March 30, 2003 01:10:00.000\");\n         assertEquals(\"ceiling minute-4 failed\",\n         \t\tdate4,\n         \t\tDateUtils.ceiling(date4, Calendar.MINUTE));\n{code}\n\nThe first assert passes, as Math.ceil behaves as it should (i.e. Mail.ceil(15.0) = 15.0).\n\nHowever, the second assert fails with:\n\n{code}\n   ceiling minute-4 failed expected:<Sun Mar 30 01:10:00 GMT+08:00 2003> but was:<Sun Mar 30 01:11:00 GMT+08:00 2003>\n{code}\n\nas the routine incorrectly (I believe) pushes the value to the next minute.\n\n\nEither the method is incorrectly named ([as previously suggested|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LANG-434?focusedCommentId=12855836#comment-12855836]) or it should probably be corrected to be consistent with expected behaviour (using Math.ceil as a benchmark).\n\nIf changing the behaviour of {{DateUtils.ceiling}} is perceived to have too many flow-on effects (e.g. backwards compatibility issues) then perhaps it should be renamed to {{DateUtils.ceil}} to make it consistent with the Math class method name and to make the change in behaviour obvious (and perhaps also have a {{DateUtils.floor}} as a synonym for {{DateUtils.truncate}}).","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"60120","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"DateUtils.ceiling does not behave correctly for dates on the boundaries","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rizariza","name":"rizariza","key":"rizariza","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ryan Holmes","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rizariza","name":"rizariza","key":"rizariza","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ryan Holmes","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Windows XP Professional\nJava 1.6","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12531406/comment/13480225","id":"13480225","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brady.ellison","name":"brady.ellison","key":"brady.ellison","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Brady Ellison","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Given this behavior the naming of this function is highly misleading.
