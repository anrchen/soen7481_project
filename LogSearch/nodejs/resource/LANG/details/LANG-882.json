The result of comparing two objects that implement CharSequence is therefore, in general, undefined. Each object may be implemented by a different class, and there is no guarantee that each class will be capable of testing its instances for equality with those of the other. *It is therefore inappropriate to use arbitrary CharSequence instances as elements in a set or as keys in a map.*\n{quote}\n\nThe current implementation causes code such as the following to not work as expected:\n\n{code}\nCharSequence cs1 = \"1 < 2\";\nCharSequence cs2 = CharBuffer.wrap(\"1 < 2\".toCharArray());\n\nSystem.out.println(StringEscapeUtils.ESCAPE_HTML4.translate(cs1));\nSystem.out.println(StringEscapeUtils.ESCAPE_HTML4.translate(cs2));\n{code}\n\n... which gives the following results (but should be identical):\n{noformat}\n1 &lt; 2\n1 < 2\n{noformat}\n\nThe problem, at a minimum, is that {{CharBuffer.equals}} is even documented in the Javadoc that:\n{quote}\nA char buffer is not equal to any other type of object.\n{quote}\n\n... so a lookup on a CharBuffer in the Map will always fail when compared against the String implementations that it contains.\n\nAn obvious work-around is to instead use something along the lines of either of the following:\n{code}\nSystem.out.println(StringEscapeUtils.ESCAPE_HTML4.translate(cs2.toString()));\nSystem.out.println(StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml4(cs2.toString()));\n{code}\n\n... which forces everything back to a {{String}}.  However, this is not practical when working with large sets of data, which would require significant heap allocations and garbage collection concerns.  (As such, I was actually trying to use the {{translate}} method that outputs to a {{Writer}} - but simplified the above examples to omit this.)\n\nAnother option that I'm considering is to use a custom {{CharSequence}} wrapper around a {{char[]}} that implements {{hashCode()}} and {{equals()}} to work with those implemented on {{String}}.  (However, this will be interesting due to the symmetric assumption - which is further interesting that {{String.equals}} is currently implemented using {{instanceof}} - even though {{String}} is {{final}}...)","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"320425","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"LookupTranslator accepts CharSequence as input, but fails to work with implementations other than String","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ziesemer","name":"ziesemer","key":"ziesemer","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mark A.

A ClassCast occurs between StringBuffer and String. This is because calling subSequence on StringBuffer returns a String (boo!), and for some reason the call to compareTo in getEntry of TreeMap doesn't like the different types. Presumably this could be solved with a custom comparator.\n\nChanging the key of the HashMap to be a String resolves the issue. It feels weird for the key to be typed; ie) if it was StringBuffer(\"foo\"), I'd expect it to match the String \"foo\" as well. Only matching the type of the input seems odd. I can see value in keeping the translate-to part of the system as CharSequence; you could have large items of text that won't be read until such a time as they need to be obtained.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bayard","name":"bayard","key":"bayard","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Henri Yandell","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-23T06:00:00.809+0000","updated":"2013-04-23T06:00:00.809+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12639615/comment/13638821","id":"13638821","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bayard","name":"bayard","key":"bayard","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Henri Yandell","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I've gone ahead with the simple solution of using String as the key.
