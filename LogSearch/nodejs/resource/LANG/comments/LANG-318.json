[This is not an issue with IBM JDK 1.5.0_3 anymore., I think we have to view the reverse order as a JVM bug. We should add code to ignore these tests when on the IBM 1.4 JVM for 3.0., I don't see any reason to have the unit tests not run for this - makes them more honest and we don't need the IBM 1.4.2 JVM to develop with. Marking as WONTFIX as it's a JVM bug (they fixed in 1.5 so presuming it's considered so).]
