    But the implementation of the method does NOT increment by 1 if given the empty string. So this change causes the documentation to contradict the implementation.
, I had voted +1 for the pull request, but then read the Javadoc again, and now I'm not sure about it :-)

>"The code increments the starting index by one, rather than by the length of the match string, so matches may overlap."

I'm not sure if there's anything wrong with the above statement for StringUtils#ordinalOf.

> But the implementation of the method does NOT increment by 1 if given the empty string. So this change causes the documentation to contradict the implementation.

Given the empty string, as far as I can tell, the implementation returns (as in the doc) "the n-th index of the search CharSequence", which is 0. It never increments the starting index (which is done here https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/blob/ff4497aff8cc9de4e0b2c6e5e23e5b6550f76f29/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/lang3/StringUtils.java#L1477).

As it was given an empty string, this check in ordinalOf method returns the empty string: https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/blob/ff4497aff8cc9de4e0b2c6e5e23e5b6550f76f29/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/lang3/StringUtils.java#L1466, Github user PascalSchumacher commented on the issue:

    `...incrementing the starting index by one after each successful match, so matches may overlap.` For empty String there is no match, so no incrementing is done.
    
    Please do not hesitate to suggest better solution for this issue. Thanks!

    I guess we should hide the implementation details and just state `Note: Matches may overlap.`.
    
    What do you think?

    Of course there are matches for the empty string. a) there is both a leading and trailing empty string in "a" for instance. b) the implementation doesn't return INDEX_NOT_FOUND when given the empty string.
    
    As far as I can tell, the implementation increments the position with 1 each time a match is found, except if the sought string is the empty string, in which case it increments with 0 (conceptually that is; in practice it obviously returns 0 right away for that case, since if it increments by 0 each match, it will never move away from 0).
    
    Personally I think the implementation is messy and hard to formalize. It would have been much better if the implementation consistently stuck the idea of incrementing by 1 for each match. This would not rule out the optimization because one would simply return n for the empty search string case.
    
    Given the situation I guess it's not an option to change the implementation though, so the only option left is to adjust the documentation to reflect the current behavior. Here are two suggestions:
    
    "increments by 1 unless the search string is the empty string in which case the position is never incremented"
    
    or something like
    
    "always returns 0 if the search string is the empty string, otherwise it increments the position by 1 for each match found"

    Oh, now it makes sense @aioobe 
    
    I like 
    
    "increments by 1 unless the search string is the empty string in which case the position is never incremented"

    Updated the pull request using "increments by 1 unless the search string is the empty string in which case the position is never incremented".

    Looks good to me, even though I think it's a terrible idea to view empty strings as some form of special strings and treat them differently than other strings.
