[This probably also affects Commons Text, Indeed Benedikt. I'll file a ticket for [text].

If methods like this are going to be deprecated (and maybe removed in the 4.x release?) in [lang], then I'd think we should just add the @deprecated annotation to the method. Other wise, I'd be inclined to leave the method name as-is (so we keep binary compatibility), return 1 - currentResult as suggested by [~jmkeil]; and maybe update the Javadocs as well.
, What about deprecating the current method (letting it stay as it is) and adding renamed copy (getJaroWinklerSimilarity). This ensures that we do not break any existing code. What do you think?
