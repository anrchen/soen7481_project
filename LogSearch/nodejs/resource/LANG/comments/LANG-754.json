[I digged into this problem and the problem you describe occurs only when using setUseShortName(true), and the class is located in the default package and the name is one of [IZFJSBDC], explanation follows.

The ToStringStyle uses ClassUtils to get the short name for the class, which uses an internal reverse abbreviation map to resolve primitive array types which are something like [B for a byte[]. Now there seems to be a bug in the ClassUtils.getShortName method as it does this reverse resolve all the time, and if you happen to have a class called B in the default package, it is wrongly identified as byte., The attached patch fixes ClassUtils.getShortName(String) to only do the reverseAbbreviation lookup if the supplied className contains an array definition.

Otherwise the abbreviated class names for primitive types are not used imho.
, Any testing you wanted to do before applying the patch Thomas?

It builds fine for me, and your explanation makes sense (though I tend not to do much with the builder code as I don't use it)., I just wanted to wait if there are other opinions on this reverse abbreviation stuff, but I think it is ok., Applied patch in r1470174.]
