[Are you really waiting, or are you just wanting to get off of local forks?

Aim is to get 3.0 out rather than doing a 2.4.1. Ideally by end of this year/January., well, I am resolved to not use any singly escaped apostrophe ''; since of course I can't just stop our project waiting for

but this might come to bite me at any time, and who knows what other bug fixes have been waiting in the code for a year..

so you're saying that people should just do a local build and just depend on a SNAPSHOT build?, Normally Lang has a release each year. The 2.4->3.0 change has slowed that down to 2 years. Given 3.0 is not backwards compatible with 2.4, I think that's fair.

Ideally I know that I'd rather not use 3.0 time to release a 2.4.1 or 2.5 unless there's a strong reason. I'm not sold on any of the bugfixes being release drivers, and the 2.x JIRA version only has a few items that are there because the code was deleted in 3.0 and a fix was also not readily identifiable.

Depending on the snapshot build would provide very useful feedback, or you could take the 2.4 source and fix the one bug affecting you in a local version.]
