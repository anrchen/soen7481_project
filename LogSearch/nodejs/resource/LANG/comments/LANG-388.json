[Patch comments out the relevant suite.addTest line indicated in the bug description, Works fine for me on Sun Java 1.4.2_16 and 1.5.0_13 on Windows XP SP2. I get the expected compiler warnings on Java 5. Please include your errors., Any details on your errors Hasan?, I have warnings-as-errors set and that was the problem. In any case, commenting this out might be a good idea with a version test., The entire enum directory is deprecated for the same reason and will be removed at some point.
No point in just removing the test case.

The workround is to leave such warnings as warnings., Yup - closing as wontfix.

All the deprecated bits will vanish in 3.0.]
