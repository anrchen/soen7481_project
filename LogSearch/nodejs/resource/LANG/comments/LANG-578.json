[This looks liked a duplicate of LANG-477 to me which was fixed in r733169:

http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=733169
, I downloaded the new version of ExtendedMessageFormat class. It runs. 
I'll use it by shadowing the ExtendedMessageFormat 2.4 by waiting the release 3.0.
Thanks.]
