Unit test
, Running through the source, the problem is that:

log(1000) / log(10)  is 2.9999999999999996 and not 3.0 as it should.

Solving this by simplifying the method of finding out how many digits there are
in a number - Integer.toString(value).length(). I've added an assert for value
being negative (using Validate). Just in case. , Adding unit test for #39410. Implementing fix by switching from using Math.log
to Integer.toString to figure out the number of digits.
