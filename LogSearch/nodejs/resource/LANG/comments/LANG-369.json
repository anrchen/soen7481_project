[Agreed - synchronizing the variable seems the best thing to do., Patch that liberally splashes synchronized around the variable., Patch looks safe., svn ci -m "Applying the synchronization from LANG-369" src/java/org/apache/commons/lang/exception/ExceptionUtils.java

Committed revision 594278., I think the wrong lock object is used in the synchronization.

The code uses the CAUSE_METHOD_NAMES object as the lock and then changes it in the synchronized block, i.e. the lock object is changed.

This occurs in removeCauseMethodName() and addCauseMethodName().

Either lock on the class, or use a dummy static final Object as the lock.

This applies to 2.4 branch and trunk
, Patch which adds static final Object as a lock., Applied patch:
