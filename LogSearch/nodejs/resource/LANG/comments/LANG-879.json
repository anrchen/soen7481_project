[Can confirm that there is a problem; this is caused by a change to the Locale class in 1.7 which now includes both script and extensions; these are now shown in the toString() output.

The current Javadoc says that it validates language and country, but does not mention variant validation. 
However it does say: "This method validates the input strictly" which suggests that it should.
It would be easy enough to reject all strings that contain "#"; this would avoid the problem entirely.

Given that some of the Java 7 Locales can only be created using Locale.forLanguageTag or Locale.Builder, there seems little point in trying to handle the additional script/extension fields which happen to be in the toString() output., URL: http://svn.apache.org/r1488038
