[Alex?, Fixed.  Please confirm.

In case you're interested, it was actually a problem in the test, not in the 
code.  The test was passing in a string with non-ascii characters.  When the 
test was compiled on a non-US/non-ASCII system, it encoded it as a different 
char, which naturally escaped/unescaped to a different entity.  The fix was to 
escape the funky characters explicitly in the test.

The line I changed had the following comment:
        // should we unicode-escape the cedilla here, for 7-bit cleanliness?
:-)
