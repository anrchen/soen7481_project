[Wondering why we mess with the version. http://www.milesdennis.com/2010/05/detecting-which-os-is-running-in-java.html seems to imply that osName matches nicely on Windows to the properties we want to set., Looks like that blog page has moved to: http://milesdennis.blogspot.co.uk/2010/05/detecting-which-os-is-running-in-java.html., I agree with [~bayard], on Windows commons-lang should use the value of os.name to determine the version. Take a look at http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8u/jdk8u40/jdk/file/tip/src/windows/native/java/lang/java_props_md.c for possible values., Patches welcome!, GitHub user hzpz opened a pull request:

    LANG-794: Use os.name only when determining Windows versions

    As suggested in previous JIRA comments and according to some other sources (see http://lopica.sourceforge.net/os.html and http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7u/jdk7u/jdk/file/tip/src/windows/native/java/lang/java_props_md.c for example) the Windows version can be determined by os.name alone. I also added a constant for Windows Server 2012.
