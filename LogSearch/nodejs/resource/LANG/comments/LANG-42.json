Patch includes a testcase that proves existence of the bug / that it's fixed,
and fixes the bug in the source.
, See also COM-1843., This appears to be already fixed in CVS and should be in the nightly build. I've
added the test case in a new method testNpeForNullElement()., *** COM-2001 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***]
