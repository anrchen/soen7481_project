[Assigning to 3.1 for investigation there. It's not blocking for 3.0., What's causing the confusion here  is that there *is* no Sun Oct 10 00:00:00 CLST 2010. The hour between midnight and 1am simply doesn't exist.The time changes immediately to Sun Oct 10 01:00:00 CLST 2010. So it's not possible to truncate the date on this particular date in the Chilean time zone.

In case you're wondering, Java handles this situation by parsing midnight as 1am:

{code:java}
TimeZone.setDefault(TimeZone.getTimeZone("Chile/Continental"));
String dateString = "2010-10-10 00:00:00.0";
SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss.S");
Date date = sdf.parse(dateString);
System.out.println(date);
{code}

Output: {{Sun Oct 10 01:00:00 CLST 2010}}.

Consequently, I don't believe this is a bug., Closing as an invalid report. Please comment again if you'd like to reopen this.]
