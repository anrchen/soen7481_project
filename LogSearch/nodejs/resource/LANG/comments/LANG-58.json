[The constants chosen are from the Joshua Bloch book Efective Java, as per the 
design of the class.

Unless this causes a real problem, I would say WONTFIX., Ok, fine w/ me. I suggest this implementation detail be documented in the code., Added:

     * <p>This adds <code>iConstant * 1</code> to the <code>hashCode</code>
     * and not a <code>1231</code> or <code>1237</code> as done in
java.lang.Boolean.
     * This is in accordance with the Effective Java design. </p>

Leaving for you to okay this Gary and close the issue if I got it right., Just be be a little more precise ;-) I would replace:

Effective Java

with:

<quote>Effective Java</quote> by Joshua Block

, Issue is now javadoc'd and considered not a problem.]
