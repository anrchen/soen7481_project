    #LANG-1114 TypeUtils.equals is broken for WildcardType

    TypeUtils.equals is broken for WildcardType, when compared with non-wildcard type.
    
    It was broken because it was returning true! Now returns false. Also added test to cover the issue.

, PR https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/pull/65 added to cover this., I've now had an email from James Carman saying my CLA has been received. Could you please tell me how I get permissions to assign this Jira to myself?, Hello [~BigAndy],

we usually don't assign special permissions to contirbutors. It's just to much managment overhead for us. Usually the committer who reviews the patch assigns the issue to himself so that everybody can see who is working on an issue.

We're currently in the middle of a SVN -> git migration. I'll apply your patch after that has finished.

Thank you!, Hello [~BigAndy],

    @datalorax Commons Lang has been migrated from svn to git. Because of this the main branch has been renamed to 'master'. Can you please rebase your work against the master branch? Thank you!
, Sure., No worries. (Btw, I notice a comment above about reopening the pull request - this was not my intent!).

    Hello @datalorax it looks like rebasing did not work the way we wanted. The diff shows more then 500 touched filed. Maybe it's easier to close this PR and recreate it against the master branch. Sorry for the inconvenience!

    Sorry (this is a bit embarrassing!), I was just playing around with the rebase and didn't mean to raise a PR against this.
