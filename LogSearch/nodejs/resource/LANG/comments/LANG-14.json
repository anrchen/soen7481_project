Adds a Throwable cause support to NotImplementedException
, Created an attachment (id=10540)
Complete patch with unit tests
, I have checked in a change to NotImplementedException that makes full use of 
the Nestable interface and structure that we already have in [lang]. If 
committers agree, this should be extended to other exceptions in the base of 
lang., NotImplementedException seems to be modified. The bug is fixed, isn'it ?, There is now a constructor NotImplementedException(String msg, Throwable cause)
so the ticket is "fixed". Stephen could you add @since tags to the new stuff?
Then we can close this ticket. Thanks!, @since done, 2.1 released, closing.]
