Patch to the unit test to show the problem.

Attached is a patch to ToStringBuilderTest.java.  If you patch the
ToStringBuilderTest.java and run the test, you will see that the test failed. 
Apply the patch intended for ReflectionToStringBuilder.java and you will see
that all tests pass.

The gist of the patch is to show that a cyclical object followed by another
object will result in a bad output string in that there is not a comma (the
default field separator) between the two objects., Patch applied., 2.1 released, closing.]
