    LANG-1251: SerializationUtils.ClassLoaderAwareObjectInputStream should use static initializer to initialize primitiveTypes map.

    `SerializationUtils.ClassLoaderAwareObjectInputStream` should use static initializer to initialize `primitiveTypes` map because initializing the map in the constructor of `ClassLoaderAwareObjectInputStream` would break thread safety. `java.util.HashMap` is not thread safe.
