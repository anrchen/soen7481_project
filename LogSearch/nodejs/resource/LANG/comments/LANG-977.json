{code}, Thanks for the quick merge!  Do you know when the 3.3 release will be cut?, Hello Chris,

We don't maintain a fixed release schedule or something like that. I planned to roll out 3.3 in early February. Currently I don't really have the time, but I'm still planning to release 3.3 in February.
