[Please specify which version of Commons Lang you are using., [~garydgregory] I am using version 3.4 with Java 8. Updated the ticket.

 

Thank you,, The StackOverflow question has an answer that explains it all in great detail.
It also explains how to avoid the warning by using a suitably typed array.

AFAICT the only way that Commons Lang could avoid this problem is to remove and replace one or both of the methods.
This will break compatibility.

Given that there is an easy work-round, I don't think that is warranted.

It might be worth adding some Javadoc to show how avoid the warning.]
