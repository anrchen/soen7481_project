What about other JDK implementations? The way you word things sounds as though you're relying on a Sun feature., Actually, I read the report as "the *current* lang code relies on a Sun feature, and should be changed.", Yes, I would prefer to see:

- simpler code IMO (like my proposal) instead of something looks odd and is undocumented in our code, or
- document our current code and explain why it works, and on what JREs it works., New code looks good. Simpler +1., In SVN.]
