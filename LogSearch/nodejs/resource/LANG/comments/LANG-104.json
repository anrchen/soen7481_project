[Going back to at least JDK 1.2.2, java.lang.Throwable implemented Serializable. Anyone 
with ideas on what could be going wrong here?

I thought maybe that Nestable was declaring itself to be Serializable at one point, but 
looking at the CVS history it never has been such. The only class in the lang.exception 
package to mess with Serializable has been NestableDelegate.
, FWIW, Sun's Java 1.1.8 defines Throwable as:
public class Throwable extends Object implements Serializable , Looks to me like serialization of NestableException is tested in
NestableExceptionTestCase.testSerialization()

It would help to see some sample code showing the failure., Closing as WORKSFORME (unreproducable)]
