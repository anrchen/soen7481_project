[In the financial industry, there are many instances of numbers that have multiple leading zeros, i.e. account ids and ssns, Currently
{code}
NumberUtils.isCreatable("002.345");
{code}
Returns {{false}}. I'm not entirely certain how we want to fix this. I've been working in this area, so I'll bring it up on the dev mailing list to see what people think., GitHub user piotrkosyoo opened a pull request:

    No problem Sir,
    Calling Number.to Float also works correctly, and I skip this point.  but maybe
     better is add the tests for this case?

    A pull request with tests for the `float` case would be welcome.
