, There does appear to be an inconsistency with:

StringUtils.containsAny("abcd", "ab", null) = false

This does assert to true when added as a test case., @Brent: StringUtils.containsAny("abcd", "ab", "cd") = false, not StringUtils.containsAny("abcd", "ab", null) = false, @Brent: I'm sorry, I didn't notice you are talking about the line above., In Git master, please verify and close.]
