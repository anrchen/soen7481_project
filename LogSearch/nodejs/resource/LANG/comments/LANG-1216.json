Tip: if you need to mention code and code lines in the ticket, it might be a good idea to say what is the HEAD commit, so that if the code changes others can still work on the issue later :-) Or just include the code in the ticket., Thanks for reporting. In version 3.5 NumberUtils#isNumber returns true for "0.1".]
