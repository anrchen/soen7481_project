[javac PsiStatus.java

PsiStatus.java:59: cannot access org.apache.commons.lang.exception.

I don't get how this is related to jetspeed, what is PsiStatus.java ?, Hi,
PsiStatus was my class; it's irrelevant, what matters is the function I was 
calling which showed that the documentation of apache commons NestableException 
is incorrect.

regards
Paul, What's the link with jetspeed ???, oops, was in the wrong bug list... I was working on jetspeed when I discovered 
this., Closed, see jetspeed]
