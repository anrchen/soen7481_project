a tiny patch which comments out the checkstyle.properties line
, Another way to deal with this problem is to create 

1. an xml config file, checkstyle.xml containing the properties in
checkstyle.properties

2. add a line to your local build.properties file (create one if you aren't
using one) that sets maven.checkstyle.properties = checkstyle.xml. This will
override the setting in project.properties.  

That way, the maven checkstyle plugin will still work for people using the old
version.

I am no maven expert, but the above is working for me.  It would probably be a
good idea for someone to add a good checkstyle.xml to cvs., Your suggestion is without a doubt the correct long term solution.  A week or so
ago when maven-b10 was released, I looked into the new checkstyle configuration
format, but didn't have to time to learn the new syntax.  My solution was meant
to be a quick fix until a proper checkstyle.xml could be constructed., Applied.
