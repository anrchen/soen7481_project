patch for NumberRange.java and NumberRangeTest.java
, This seems like a reasonable extension to the API, however it does add a level 
of complexity. Is this now covered by [math]?

Also, the patch would affect Serialization, so this needs to be thought about., In response to Stephen's comment, we have nothing like this in [math]. 

I am -0 on this change, however, for the following reasons.
First, as Stephen points out, the change would affect serialization. Second,
while the extension makes sense logically, I am not sure that is has tremendous
practical value.  For integer ranges, (a,b) is no different from [a+1, b-1] --
i.e., being able to specify "inclusivity" does not really buy you anything other
than convenience (at the expense of a more complicated API and some overhead). 
For floating point ranges, counting on the difference between (a,b) and [a,b]
would in most cases I can imagine be dangerous -- so here again, the extension
does not really buy you anything.  

I may of course be missing some important and valuable use cases, in which case
I will happily move to +0 once I know what they are.
, I've marked this as WONTFIX.  I had a reason to use something like this, but 
in the meantime, I've solved this problem through other means.  I do agree 
with Phil that this adds unnecessary complexity in Math at a time when math 
should be reaching a point of stability.]
