[Better example, +1, Added test.
Changed code to catch ArrayStoreException and report IllegalArgument if types are not compatible

URL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=892114&view=rev
Log:
LANG-567 - ArrayUtils.addAll(T[] array1, T... array2) does not handle mixed types very well
Also remove unnecessary main() and suite() from test class, Do you want to include the root cause to the IAE? I am not a fan of swapping exception types without chaining them., I did consider checking the types before trying the array copy in which case the issue would not have arisen.

However it should be cheaper to wait until a problem occurs, and also slightly safer in case the check is too strict.

I'll update the code shortly., Sebb, I agree. The code should assume things work, and catch exceptions for the exceptional cases. ]
