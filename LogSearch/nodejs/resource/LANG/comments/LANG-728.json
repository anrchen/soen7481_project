[Test code and patch for org/apache/commons/lang/Entities.java., The API has changed in Lang 3.0; however the issue remains. A failing test (with @Ignore) has been added to StringEscapeUtilsTest. Need to resolve this in 3.0.1., Happiness. This is fixed in 3.0 already! :)

It wasn't clear because escapeXml no longer escapes entities above 7f, instead you have to do a bit more work to get that. Here is the code you would need:

{code:java}
        CharSequenceTranslator escapeXml =
            StringEscapeUtils.ESCAPE_XML.with( UnicodeEscaper.between(0x7f, Integer.MAX_VALUE) );

        assertEquals("Supplementary character must be represented using a single escape", "\u233B4",
                escapeXml.translate("\uD84C\uDFB4"));
{code}

Also note the need to use a unicode escape and not a numeric entity in Java.

This has been added to the unit tests run each time. Marking this as Fixed in 3.0., Reopening as I explained things badly. , I used the wrong translator :) Code should be:

{code:java}
        CharSequenceTranslator escapeXml =
            StringEscapeUtils.ESCAPE_XML.with( NumericEntityEscaper.between(0x7f, Integer.MAX_VALUE) );

        assertEquals("Supplementary character must be represented using a single escape", "&#144308;",
                escapeXml.translate("\uD84C\uDFB4"));
{code}

ie) Ignore the 'note the' comment. , Closing again as 'fixed in 3.0'.]
