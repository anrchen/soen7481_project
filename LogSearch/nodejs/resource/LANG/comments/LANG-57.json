patch adds instanceof check to Enum.equals().
, Does this patch work with the intended feature of the "} catch
(ClassCastException ex) {" block? Is there a unit test that checks the "} catch
(ClassCastException ex) {" behavior?, I changed the Enum.equals method to avoid cast exceptions.  The thought being, 
an equality check between objects of different types should return false and 
not raise an exception.

The unit test assures a ClassCastException is not thrown when comparing objects 
of different types.

FYI, by different types I mean objects that fail an instanceof check., The issue is that it looks like the author of the code had clear intentions when
writting the catch block, which this patch seems to circumvent. What that last
else and catch blcok do is allow Enum instance to work even though they might
come  from different class loaders. I think your patch might break this feature.
I also do not think there is a unit test that validates this feature. So, that
would be the first thing to do: add a unit test that checks that Enums from
different class loaders can be tested., Fixed as a side effect of fixing 26876. Added a unit test for this case., 2.1 released, closing.]
