[The 'h' and 'k' formats display hour 0 as 12/24 respectively, so the code needs to convert 12/24 to 0 on input.

The code uses modulo arithmetic to handle the conversion from 12 => 0 and 24 => 0.
Modulo has the same result for 12/24, but behaves differently from SDF lenient mode when the values are greater than 12/24.

Furthermore, the code applies the modulo conversion to the 'h' and 'H' formats, instead of the 'h' and 'k' formats.

This was not picked up by the unit tests as there were no tests that covered the conditions., URL: http://svn.apache.org/r1663348
