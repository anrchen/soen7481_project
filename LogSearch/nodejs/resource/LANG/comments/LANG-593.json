[Worth reporting to wherever JDK 1.7 bugs get reported nowadays?, I tested b78 - but the latest available is b84, so probably a good idea to check if its still a problem in that version first.

   http://download.java.net/jdk7/binaries/

If it is a problem I guess the place to report it is here:
  https://jdk7.dev.java.net/servlets/ProjectIssues, Note to test under JDK 7 before release., With b102 the same problem with FastDateFormatTest exists
With b124 the same problem with FastDateFormatTest exists and now ExtendedMessageFormatTest also fails

The problem with ExtendedMessageFormatTest is that it is using Locale.getDefault() when no Locale is supplied, which is returning Locale..en_US - but DateFormat & Number format are now (in b124) using the new Locale.getDefault(Locale.Category.FORMAT) which is returning Locale.en_GB. So this appears to be a bug in the 1.7 JDK, Sounds good. 2 bugs in JDK; nothing to hold up a release on our side. , Need to report bugs back to JDK, but no reason to link this to the next release (or any release really)., Resolving as fixed.

We fixed the JDK 7 'yyy' issue in LANG-719 prior to releasing 3.0. The other issue didn't show up iirc.]
