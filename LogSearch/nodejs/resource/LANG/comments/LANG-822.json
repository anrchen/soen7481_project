[Attached patch moves the check for "--" to the corresponding createBigDecimal method and throws an appropriate exception instead., Thanks for the patch; applied with minor changes to strengthen test case.

It's still possible that the check for "--" is redundant, but at least now the code is consistent in applying the check and reporting the exception.]
