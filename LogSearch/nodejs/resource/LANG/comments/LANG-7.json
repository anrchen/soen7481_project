[Well spotted, thanks. Change made., As per the online javadocs:
http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/lang/api/org/apache/commons/lang/StringUtils.html#replace(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String,%20java.lang.String)

This seems to have not been fixed:

 StringUtils.replace(null, *, *)        = null
 StringUtils.replace("", *, *)          = ""
 StringUtils.replace("aba", null, null) = "aba"
 StringUtils.replace("aba", null, null) = "aba"
 StringUtils.replace("aba", "a", null)  = "aba" 
 StringUtils.replace("aba", "a", "")    = "aba" <-- here
 StringUtils.replace("aba", "a", "z")   = "zbz", Changing this to 'fixed' since this issue has been addressed in the source
repository.

The javadoc available at http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/lang/api/index.html
reflects the latest released version (2.0) of commons-lang. In that version the
issue were present. The online javadoc will however be updated when the next
version of commons-lang is released., 2.1 released, closing.]
