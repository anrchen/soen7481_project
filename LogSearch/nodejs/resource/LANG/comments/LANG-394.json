[Hi, this is not an EqualsBuilder bug, but rather a misuse of the Collection interface:

The general contract for Collection#equals(Object) is the same as Object#equals(Object), ie a Collection is only equals to itself.
(see http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/Collection.html#equals(java.lang.Object))

Whereas the contract for List#equals(Object) is that a List is equals to any List of the same size which contains the same objects in the same order.
(see http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/List.html#equals(java.lang.Object))

That's why your current test fails; instead of returning an unmodifiableCollection, try returning an unmodifiableList (which compares to other lists by value and not by reference).

Hope this help,
Julien, Many thanks for that explanation Julien, the javadoc definitely backs up what you're saying and so I'm closing this issue.]
