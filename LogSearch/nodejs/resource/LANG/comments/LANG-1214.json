["abbreviationMap" is also used by the "primitiveToWrapper" method and for this the "void -> V" mapping seems correct.

A patch/pull request for this issue would be most welcome., I'm not sure I understand; as far as I can tell, {{primitiveToWrapper}} uses the {{primitiveWrapperMap}}, which has a separate entry for {{void}} (though that entry is also confusing; {{void}} is not autoboxed to/from {{Void}} by Java, and the entry maps anyway to {{Void.TYPE == void.class}} instead of {{Void.class}}; I feel like it's a confusing substitute for what is actually a special case in the autoboxing-handling code).

This is independent of {{abbreviationMap}} and {{reverseAbbreviationMap}}, all uses of which seem to relate to array type class names (see https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/blob/master/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/lang3/ClassUtils.java)., GitHub user henryptung opened a pull request:

    LANG-1214 Handle "void" in ClassUtils.getClass()

    `getClass()` previously deferred to an array type to get the class,
    but this fails for `void`, which lacks an array type.
    Instead, map explicitly from primitive name to primitive class.
    
    Added unit test line fails before change, passes after change.
