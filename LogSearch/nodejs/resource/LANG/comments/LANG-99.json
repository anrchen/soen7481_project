[Well, this is a tricky one. I feel the basic problem is that the Javadoc
underspecifies the behavior of both methods, so perhaps we could discuss first
what the behavior /should be/. 

The heart of the problem is that the CharSetUtils method is a one pass map-style
of method, while the StringUtils method is not, it uses a nested loop, which is
somewhat contradictory to the Javadoc comment of doing the work "in one go"., This sort of translate functionality exists in other languages, too. Perl and 
PHP both have them, and they work the way that translate() worked in 1.0.1. 
Regardless of what the new replaceChars() method is trying to do, it would be 
nice to have something backwards compatible with translate() that shares common 
behavior with similar methods in other languages., CVS implementation now works for the supplied test case.
ReplaceChars() differs from Translate() in the deletion behaviour when 
replaceChars is shorter than searchChars. This is documented in CharSetUtils., 2.1 released, closing.]
