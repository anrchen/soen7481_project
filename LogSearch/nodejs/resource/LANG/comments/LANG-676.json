[I think this issue is invalid. There's nothing wrong with methods that return Boolean objects, which could be null. The method, after all, is toBooleanObject. An object can be null., 
So it's someone's own fault if they do the following?

  boolean b = BooleanUtils.toBooleanObject(3, 1, 2, 3);
, Absolutely., No other comments, so I'll close this as wontfix., Could perhaps add a short note to the Javadoc warning about the possible behaviour under autoboxing?, svn ci -m "Adding note on potential NPE if autoboxing occurs per LANG-676"
