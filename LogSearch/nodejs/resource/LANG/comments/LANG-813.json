[Another optimisation would be to check that the lengths are the same.
The code already calculates both lengths, so this would not add any overhead and would be more efficient for sequences that differ only in length., URL: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1361462&view=rev

LANG-813 StringUtils.equalsIgnoreCase doesn't check string reference equality
Also check lengths.
