[This is not a commons-lang issue. Which version of PMD that Maven tries to
download is controlled by your installation of Maven. More specifically the
Maven PMD plug-in. If you upgrade that plug-in to the latest version (1.7) it
will use PMD 3.2.

You can find instructions on how to upgrade your plug-in here:
