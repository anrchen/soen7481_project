[Hi all,

After a bit of research, it seem to be a known issue when unicode is contained on a String object ([ref|https://www.quora.com/Is-Javas-toLowercase-string-method-reliable-for-Unicode] ), String.toLowerCase() would produce a incorrect result.

In this case "\u0130" would become a String object with three char which are [ i,  ̇, x] instead of [ İ, x].

So by given a incorrect result from .toLowCase() method, StringUtils.replaceIgnoreCase end attempt to access the segment of string which is not exist which is 3 in this case while str.length() is 2.

The fixture I come up with is replacing the .toLowcase() to .toUpperCase() in order to avoid the mis-interprettion on .toLowerCase while performing case-insensitive comparisons.

    [LANG-1406]  StringIndexOutOfBoundsException in StringUtils.replaceIgnoreCase

    Fix for Lang-1406 to avoid any exception while performing String.UTils.replaceIgnoreCase() against uniCode String object. 
    
    Plz let me if there have any extra things need to be done for this PR since I am the first timer for commons-lang project( add more test case?).
    
    All the best

    I'm surprised by this bug. Had no idea something like this could happen. Will debug later and see if I can understand why that happens (might have to train my brain to default to always use uppercase instead of lowercase?). Thanks for the pull request, we will review the code and if everything looks OK a committer will merge it.

    Oh, that does make sense now. So the first visible character we see is the ["Latin Capital Letter I with Dot Above"](https://unicode-table.com/en/#0130) (see also [this other link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotted_and_dotless_I)), and the second an `x`. And doing `toUpperCase()` simply won't change it as it's considered already upper case.
    
    When doing a `toLowerCase`, it gets translated into two visible characters. The second is the normal `x`. While the first contains two codepoints. I tested in Python, and got the lower case `i` (`print(u"\u0069")`) followed by a character invisible by itself (`print (u"\u0307")`).
    
    The special/invisible character, is visible when coming after certain letters.
    
    ```python
    >>> print(u"\u0307")
    
    >>> print(u"\u0069\u0307")
    i̇
    >>> print(u"\u0068\u0307")
    ḣ
    >>> print(u"\u0067\u0307")
    ġ
    >>> print(u"\u0067\u0307")
    ```
    
    When we get these invisible characters, as we have one code point more, the length returned is not 2, but 3. Resulting in exception in this issue.
    
    I don't believe the fix here would fix the reverse case, where we had a lower case, single codepoint, unicode; that would be represented by a two code codepoint. The exception could happen again (I haven't investigated whether such case exist, but I'm assuming there could be such case - if not now, maybe a character could still be added in future editions).
    
    What do you think @HiuKwok ? Any suggestions? I'm not sure if there's any easy way to fix this case, except by adding a note to the documentation saying that the method is not intended to be used with unicode strings, as it doesn't handle supplementary characters well. Or maybe we could try to remove the `length()` call around the `StringBuilder`'s near the end of the method...

    Just leaving a comment here too to have a review here in GitHub. While your example works, as the character is considered already in upper case, the reverse case would still fail after changing from `toLowerCase` to `toUpperCase`. So I think we should find another solution or update the documentation stating how the code works with unicode.

    Hi @kinow, yes you are right after I did try to come up with a draft java main to generate all || most unicode in string and compare it's length between original, toLowerCase() and to UpperCase().
    
    ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37996731/44028895-032488d4-9f2e-11e8-839b-c1259a182b8e.png)
      
    It's seem like no matter which one we pick (toLowerCase || toUpperCase), it would still tend to come up with a incorrect length.
    
    Just a quick question what you mean by remove the ```length( )``` mean? Would you mind to specify more on that? 
    
    Thanks,

    Oohh, great testing @HiuKwok ! Thanks for sharing here.
    
    >Just a quick question what you mean by remove the length( ) mean? Would you mind to specify more on that?
    
    Sure. I think there could be a possibility to fix the issue by addressing how the length of the lower'ed/upper'ed text is used https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/blob/590f90889bf61a5570bd98b78e73410a07d7410b/src/main/java/org/apache/commons/lang3/StringUtils.java#L5603
    
    So maybe there could be another way to work around the way we use the strings lengths, and avoid the exception.

    @kinow May be try to store a original text.length before performance any upper || lower case operation and make use of it?
    
    haha, it's just a thought. Would try out later

    @kinow It turn out the problem is large than that, because the incorrect length basically affecting the whole method, especially the part which involve parsing inside the while loop.

    Yeah, a very slippery problem. We still have the option to simply document that the method does not work well with unicode strings. 
    
    But first I would like to spend at least a few hours with paper and pencil (and eraser, because this could take a bit till I give up or find a possible way around it), and perhaps even check in the mailing list if other devs have any idea.
    
    I think you found a very interesting problem (*)! Keep the ideas coming if you have any on how to solve this issue :+1: 
    
    _* if I had more time, I would possibly either go through other methods checking for that or, just try some fuzzifier approach to test the whole project ! Not aware of any static or dynamic analysis tool that does that_

    Hi all, Just a quick update finally I kind of figure the way out of this problem,
    while I am trying to make it happen (the implementation).
    But the concept is mainly Normalize incoming word at the beginning of the method call by ```Normalizer.normalize()```
, Github user HiuKwok commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/pull/340
  
    To whom who interested in this issue, here is some founding that I discovered throughout this month of issue solving. 
    
    Problem:
     - The exception would happened when any String object passed in with unicode character. In order to achieve ignore case replacement, the internal logic would first transform both `text` and `SearchString` to lowerCase( ) for comparaition.   
    
    - However if anyone passion enough to digger deeper into the src logic of `.toLowerCase( )`. Certain unicode character would be denormalized. In this way the result String length would tend to longer than original length().  Example like:  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37996731/45103213-efec8780-b161-11e8-8370-88a7edacfc42.png)
    So making use of the transformed String, Out bound exception would happen when trying to access the index that doesn't access at all (3 in this case vs 2 in length before lowerCase).
    
    Flow:
    
     - So the first thought into my mind is, why dun just normalize both `text` and `searchString` before performing ignore case comparation? In this way the String length would always stay consistence no matter `toLowerCase( )` or `toUpperCase( )` 3 -> 3.  However the another problem would emerged, as you may noticed, while the String mentioned above denormalize, it would turn into a UpperCase I and a dot sign. 
    
    - But what happen if the search pattern emerge into searchText in decompose form. In this case let say I am trying to match a upper [I]. Then mismatch would happen and this is certain not the desire behavior of this method I believe. 
    
    BTW I Drafted a simple main method to demonstrate how mismatch would happen in here.
    
    https://github.com/HiuKwok/commons-lang/blob/master/src/main/java/com/hiukwok/test.java#L10-L20
    

, I've been thinking - how do case-insensitive regular expressions handle this? Theoretically these should do the same thing:
{code}
StringUtils.replaceIgnoreCase("\u0130x", "x", "");
Pattern.compile("x", Pattern.CASE_INSENSITIVE).matcher("\u0130x").replaceAll("");
{code}
The Matcher.replaceAll(String) method does not throw an exception.

So what is the difference? The Pattern.newSingle(int) method is the key thing to look at. It uses Character.toUpperCase(char) and Character.toLowerCase(char), which do not have the same behavior as String.toUpperCase() and String.toLowerCase(). The Character class produces a single character.

So I think a possible naive solution to this would be to call Character.toLowerCase() on each character in the String and then append the characters together into a new String.
{code}
String text = "foo";
char[] chars = text.toCharArray();
for (int i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
    chars[i] = Character.toLowerCase(chars[i]);
}
String lowerText = new String(chars);
{code}, Github user kinow commented on the issue:

    Good progress so far @HiuKwok . Understanding the problem well is a good first step to solve it 👍 my next development cycle for Apache will probably be for a release for Apache Commons Imaging, then after that Lang+Text. So will try to help here if you haven't found a way to solve it yet.
, Hi [~michaelryan]

I have try to implement your idea into the actual codebase against it. According to the theory the out of bound exception should be fixed.
 As one to one mapping is performed during the .toLowerCase process. It's guaranteed to always give back the same length of String in return.[Here|https://github.com/HiuKwok/commons-lang/commit/a998e3de65a59d0859157f99e6cdf99469aa009f] is the commit btw.

However on certain situation seems would leads to mismatch, which I listed the fail case on the same commit as well.]
