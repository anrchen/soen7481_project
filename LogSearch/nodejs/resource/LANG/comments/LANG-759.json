[Patches welcome! :), Here you are, I did not find a way to enhance the unit test to really cover these..., The patch did not apply to trunk so I re coded it and marked @since 3.1 based on recent ML discussion., In SVN @since 3.1., Thanks for the quick response, I did this on a fresh svn checkout of trunk, so strange that it did not apply cleanly, was it because of newlines?, I can't quite recall why it did not apply. ]
