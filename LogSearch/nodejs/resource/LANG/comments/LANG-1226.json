[Ugh, my initial impression is that I'd like to have a {{normalizeSpace()}} that works à la Java spaces and another {{normalizeXmlSpace()}} that works à la XML., See LANG-1227 - any XML methods need to be sensitive to the XML spec version.
Maybe such methods belong in the XMLCharacter class.
StringUtils could have a wrapper that delegates to it.

e.g.

StringUtils.normalizeXmlSpace(String input, XMLCharacter#enum XML version) {
    return XMLCharacter.getInstance(version).normalizeSpace(input);
