[Does not appear to be related to Commons LANG or even Commons, you have lost me now !!!!!!!!!, Jason,

We do not understand your request. This is the JIRA instance for the Apache Software Foundation. Which piece of Apache software is it you are reporting a bug in?, Cloudstack 4.0 said it supports RBD (ceph Storage). I have a running cloudstack 4.0 but i cannot add RBD storage. On google this i found the RBD needs libvirt 0.10.0 with RBD enabled, cloudstack 4.0 is currently running libvirt 0.9.8. I have have tied many ways to install libvirt 0.10.0 and 1.0.0 but this stops cloud-agent from running. If cloudstack supports RBD why doesnt it install the correct libvirt version when install the cloud-agent. , Sorry, but nothing you mentioned is related to anything in the projects of Apache Commons (http://commons.apache.org). And please also note, that JIRA is an issue tracker, but not a support forum. If you are looking for help, you will have to use the appropriate mailing list of that project (seems to be http://incubator.apache.org/cloudstack/, found by Google).

Apache houses more than 100 top level projects. What you do here is like penetrating the customer support of Sony Music because your Sony TV does not displays DVDs from your player., .]
