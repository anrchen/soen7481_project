 }                       , I've tested this (see the above diff) and it appears to be fixed already. There
is already a unit test for this (well, basic array rather than multi array) that
refers to the issue that I'm declaring this issue a duplicate of.

*** This bug has been marked as a duplicate of 33067 ***, Closing this duplicate - hoping to see a notification on the list., Reopening so I can resolve it. Seen this happen occasionally in Jira, though only previously when the workflow was being mucked around with. Artifact of the migration I guess - having an issue that is closed but has an unresolved status., Closing again.]
