Resubmitting implementation patch in plain text format.
, Given the changes made in response to COM-960, should I submit new patches based on the 
state of CVS now?  The old patches did not change the contract of this family of methods, and 
neither would new ones., There is an informal rule in StringUtils that we don't use a boolean flag to 
distinguish between two method variants. Instead we use an alternate 
descriptive name. splitByString() may be a possible name.

Also, any patches should use the style of the surrounding code - brackets at 
end on line in this case., Darn, I was hoping this would be a generalization of the existing split() family, and the way I came 
up with to delegate existing behavior to the existing methods was to change the method 
signature.

I'm happy to change the method name if that's what's needed (and reformat opening brace 
placement)., Methods committed as splitByWholeSeparator method. Opinions and a better name
are both desired., 2.1 released, closing.]
