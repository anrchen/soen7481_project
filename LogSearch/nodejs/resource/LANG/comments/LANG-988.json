That's probably a good idea., Hello Martin,

what kind of information are you looking for? The user guide just contained descriptions of the classes we have in commons.

I've created a new component in jira and added this ticket to it., I think this issue can be closed - the original question is answered. If changes are desired for the user guide, they can be described in a new improvement issue., Maybe we should remove the "User Guide" page on the website or put some useful content there... I've though about something that gives you a better overview over the functionality provided in [LANG] alongside some code examples.]
