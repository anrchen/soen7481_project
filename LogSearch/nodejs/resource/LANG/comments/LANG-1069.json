[Tried to explain corner-case usage of negating character and added unittest.
* CharSet.getInstance("^^a-d")
* CharSet.getInstance("a-d^"), Can you explain why you think {{CharSet.getInstance("^^a-d")}} is a corner case? You've explicitly listed it in the documentation as an example, but I don't understand why it requires special attention., I tried to show with this example that parsing is executed from left to right. So the set containing a ^ is negated. The second ^ could also negate the set containing a-d and then interpreting the first ^ in some undefined way., Thanks for the patch. I edited it a little and have now committed it:

New Revision: 1672833

URL: http://svn.apache.org/r1672833
Log:
Update for LANG-1069: CharSet.getInstance documentation does not clearly explain how to include negation character in set. Javadoc expanded and unit tests added to match examples. Based on patch by Arno Noordover.
