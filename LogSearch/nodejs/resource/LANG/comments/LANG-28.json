Add the ClassUtils.primitivesToWrappers method and the related test case
, Modified somewhat. The patch does some optimising in that if none of the
elements are primitive classes, then it returns the original array. It's not
what a user would expect, so I've simplified it to always return a new array,
regardless. Also a few style and javadoc changes., 2.1 released, closing.]
