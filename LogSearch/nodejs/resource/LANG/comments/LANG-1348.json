[Patches welcome ;-), I started poking into this. It's a sweet circular call. 
You wind up at TypeUtils, Line 1672. This calls typeVariableToString, into the if block.
This, line 1775, calls the appendToAll method. You will hit line 1846... which calls the same toString function that you called in the first place. 

I don't have a remediation plan. But maybe that will help!, I'm working on a patch trying to stop the circular call., GitHub user mbusso opened a pull request:
