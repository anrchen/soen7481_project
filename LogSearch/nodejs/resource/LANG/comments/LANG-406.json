[Patch #3:  Fraction.toString() and Fraction.toProperString() should use FractionFormat, to keep all fraction formatting/parsing in one (IMO here=the right) place., Only opinion so far is that 2.4 is close enough to start asking whether we want to add new issues to 2.4. The last batch got added because this'll be an M2 release and we were blocked on the unreleased commons-parent pom. That's no longer blocking us now., As always, I"m fine with whatever consensus says.  Though if this code is such that we don't have any contention over it, this issue could be resolved before the other two we've got outstanding., I'm not sure why we have Fraction in both Lang and Math - I guess historically they just evolved separately. The duplication does seem like a waste of effort though and Math IMO is a better location - also Math already has a FractionFormat implementation. Perhaps would be a good idea to compare both Fraction implementations and ensure that one supports all features of the other and then deprecate one.

http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/commons/proper/lang/trunk/src/java/org/apache/commons/lang/math/, Ah... actually I began working on this before even realizing [math] had a Fraction (not being a consumer, never thought about it), much less a FractionFormat.  I only learned about the [math] Fraction from your (Niall's) recent JIRA comments.  I will check out the [math] FractionFormat and make sure it's up to snuff.  ;)  If that all works out, then should we not also deprecate oacl.math.Fraction?, I'm okay to drop this.]
