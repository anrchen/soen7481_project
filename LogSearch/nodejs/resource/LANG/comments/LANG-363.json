[Here's a patch that should fix the issue described.  Also included is an extra assertion in testEscapeJavaScript of StringEscapeUtilsTest., Heh - I even had a play with this when looking at the Spring one: http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/spring/browse/SPR-1754

Not sure why I didn't submit a fix, probably too green with Spring at the time. , Thanks again Scott (and Situ for reporting it), patch applied:
