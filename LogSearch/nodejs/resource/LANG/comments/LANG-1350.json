    LANG-1350: Fix varargs array invokeConstructor

    If ConstructorUtils.invokeConstructor(Class, Object...) is invoked with an array of arguments whose classes do not match a constructor exactly (for example, a subclass is used) and an array is used for a varargs parameter, then the array is not matched to the varargs parameter type.
