[I can confirm that this is a bug. The following test will fail:

{code:java}
    @Test
    public void testLANG1120() throws Exception {
        assertEquals("ALOSZZCN aloszzcn", StringUtils.stripAccents("ĄŁÓŚŻŹĆŃ ąłóśżźćń"));
    }
{code}

Output is:

{code}
org.junit.ComparisonFailure: 
Expected :ALOSZZCN aloszzcn
Actual   :??�????? ??�?????
{code}
