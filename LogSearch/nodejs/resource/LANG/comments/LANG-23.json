[I used 
String a = StringUtils.leftPad("abcd", 10, "0");
instead and it worked (a pad string and not a pad character), Could you be compiling and runing with two different versions of the jar?, I can't see this being anything other than Gary's suggestion of a
compile/runtime mismatch between jars.]
