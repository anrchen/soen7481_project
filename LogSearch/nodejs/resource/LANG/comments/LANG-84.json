127, I beleive 
is not ASCII, it has some special dreadfull meaning, like
erasing the prev character, but 
anyway, I beleive it's not ASCII.

I beleive ASCII are 32-126
(If I recall ISO-2022 
correctly)
, That is a good point -- 127 should probably be excluded, since it is in any case
not printable. My mistake. The bound for this should be left as is in the code,
but it should be made clear in the javadoc that returned characters will be
between 32 and 126 inclusive. , Fixes applied as discussed below.
