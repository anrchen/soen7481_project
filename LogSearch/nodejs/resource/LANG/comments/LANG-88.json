Patch from src directory
, The patch doesn't include the Adaptor Registry, but only provides a patch for 
the LangTestSuite.  I think this is probably because the CVS Diff didn't find 
the Adaptor Registry in the repository (as might be expected since it is a 
proposed addition) and therefore did not provide patch information - nothing 
to patch.  

I think the new files need to be attached separately, and the patch provided 
be applicable only to the LangTestSuite.  , Created an attachment (id=5361)

, Just added the missing files.  I should have checked the patch before 
uploading it (just trying to do too, too much at once).  Looks like something 
munged the eols (Eclipse? CVS? The Fates?), so the patch isn't very useful 
anyway., *** COM-379 has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***, This is a post 2.0 release., I'm closing this on grounds of WONTFIX. The code definitely seems useful, 
however in my mind it is at a slightly higher level than [lang] targets 
(especially as [lang] has now stabilised with slightly fewer packages than it 
might have had)

It would seem to sit better with the [convert] project, or maybe [hivemind]. It 
just adds a little element of 'religion' that I would have to -1 in [lang].]
