[I'm not sure what the issue is here: the two calendars objects are not the same, because they have different TimeZones.

This seems to be more about how calendar objects behave when their timezone is changed., I agree with that (the objects aren't the same), but shouldn't the months of both calendars match? Which is the same as saying that the last line should return 0, right?

As a clear example, the month of 11-6-2012 (GMT-3) is the same as the month of 11-20-2012 (GMT-7), right? 
What am I thinking wrong here?, AFAICT, the problem arises in your test because the calendar objects are created with the default timezone and the timezone is then changed.

If you change the default timezone before creating the calendar objects, then they truncate as expected.
However they still won't be equal because of the time zone difference.

I'm also not clear what the use case is here., Thanks for clearing that, so the method truncates taking account of the current timezone of the calendar.

I was having problems when comparing:
1-an XMLGregorianCalendar converted to Calendar (XMLGregorianCalendar doesn't have the concept of DST, so the timezone is converted to GMT-2 in this timezone) with
2-a GregorianCalendar created with "new GregorianCalendar()" which has a timezone of "America/Montevideo".

According to the comments, my code should set the timezone of the converted XMLGregorianCalendar to America/Montevideo before using the truncate method.

Thanks again, I had thought that the truncatedCompareTo should compare dates managing the timezone before comparing., Looks like this conversation was resolved :)]
