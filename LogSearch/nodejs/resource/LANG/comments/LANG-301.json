[Moving this back to 3.0. 

There are three things to do here, if reasons for the current code don't show up:

1) Refactor the cloneReset method away. It's possible that it's setup this way to be more useful for subclasses. 
2) Switch from returning null to throwing CloneNotSupported.
3) Stop supporting clone() and Cloneable.

The latter 2 definitely need to wait for 3.0, the former is not very critical., The cloneReset() method exists to enable testing.

The return null should never happen, as super.clone() should succeed. Its really just a way around the JDK flaw of the exception not being a runtime exception.]
