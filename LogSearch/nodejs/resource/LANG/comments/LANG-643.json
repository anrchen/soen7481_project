[Thanks Volker. The javadoc has been fixed in svn., Thanks ... and now for a little nitpicking (sorry):

As mentioned before the javadoc for param "len" still is a bit overly strict:
"len - the length of the required String{color:red}, must be zero or positive{color}"

Since it must not, as discussed.

Again: left(), right() and mid().

V., Please, nit pick away :)
