[That does not make sense based on the tests we have the behavior with other params:

{{StringUtils.isAnyEmpty(null)}} is the same as {{StringUtils.isAnyEmpty([null])}}, an array with one element, a null.

Note that {{StringUtils.isAnyEmpty([null, "foo"]) returns {{true}}.

You might be confusing:
- StringUtils.isAnyEmpty((String[]) null) return false, this actually passes a null
- {{StringUtils.isAnyEmpty(null)}} is the same as {{StringUtils.isAnyEmpty([null])}}, an array with one element, a null
 , Maybe better to specify this behavior appropriately in javadoc. Because it's confusing at the moment., I updated the Javadoc in git master. Please verify and close.

If anyone of you would like to participate and volunteer to improve the Javadoc for the other methods in this class, please provide a PR on GitHub at [https://github.com/apache/commons-lang]

Thank you!
