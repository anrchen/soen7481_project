[Change made which should deal with this situation.
Thanks for the report and test.
Stephen, I just checked the changes in CVS. If I read the code correctly, it will now 
discard any field name containing a '$' character. This may be too restrictive 
since '$' is a legal identifier part AFAIK.

Also, I have thought a bit more about the problem. It is actually a more 
general problem than the one I reported. Inner classes are not the only way you 
could have mutually recursive data structures. So perhaps we should think of a 
more general way of preventing this infinite loop. I have not made any solution 
yet, but I think it might be solved using a Set of references to already 
traversed instances and then avoid traversing an instance if it has already 
been traversed.]
