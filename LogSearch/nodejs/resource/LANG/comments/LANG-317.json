[I believe the solution you need here is that you'll need to define serialVersionUID in your de.fraport.biaf.apm.user.UserRoleEnum class. The one in the ValuedEnum is private., Till now we didn't try this because if a JDK 1.5 client communicates with the server (1.5 <-> 1.5) the problem does not arise. It is not known to me that in serialisation JDK 1.5 has a different behavior than JDK 1.4., This has less to do with the JDK, but more with the compiler you're using. E.g. if you have compiled the class with Eclipse (it uses *always* the internal compiler and not the selected JDK's one) it will have a different serialVersionUID generated that the same class from the Sun compiler from the identical JDK. The only way to get them compatible is to define an own serialVersionUID., Closing this issue - JÃ¶rg's reply seems good to me. 

Please reopen if that didn't help.]
