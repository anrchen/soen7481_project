[Seems that the piece of code in the description doesn't exists anymore. The initial buffer size is being calculated as:

{code}
int noOfItems = endIndex - startIndex;
....
StringBuilder buf = new StringBuilder(noOfItems * 16);
{code}
Using this implementation solves the issue?, Agreed. Resolving this as Not A Problem.]
