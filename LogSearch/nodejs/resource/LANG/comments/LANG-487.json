[If the setDefaultStyle() method is not used, then the class is not thread-hostile, so the Javadoc should at least point this out.

The get/setDefaultStyle() methods should really be synch, otherwise there is no guarantee what one thread will get when another sets.

If this were done, then it would be safe to call the set() method before any use is made of the class.

Users that provide a non-null ToStringStyle to constructors and static methods should not be affected by changes to the default style, so perhaps the constructors should enforce this., Rewrite for 3.0 to deal with/remove the static variable?, Variable made volatile.

I propose we close this call., Closing per Stephen's commit.]
