, Created an attachment (id=4155)
Patch to version 1.2
, Patch applied with some modifications. Please check CVS to confirm.

I would appreciate further patches for Equals, HashCode and CompareTo builders 
if you have a chance ;-), I have looked at the mods to my patch and find that all is well with the 
exception of the mismatch between the code and the in-line comment:

//throw a runtime exception in case the impossible happens.

This comment is not followed by a throw. Either the comment should be removed 
or the throw re-inserted., I will try to take a look at Equals, HashCode and CompareTo sometimes this 
week., Please bug id 16193 for hierarchy support in EqualsBuilder.reflectionEquals()., Please bug id 16227 for hierarchy support in CompareToBuilder.reflectionCompare
().
Please bug id 16228 for hierarchy support in hashCodeBuilder.reflectionHashCode
().
