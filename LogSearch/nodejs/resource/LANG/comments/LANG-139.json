[Also breaks on JDK 1.2.2 on Linux. 

One possible way to get around it is the rather dubious use of an explicitly named 
OperationEnum$1 class. [ie) not an anonymous inner class, but pretending to be]., Change made to OperationEnum. Can someone try it on Linux to see if it fixes 
it??, The tests and all sources now compile and run fine for me under Sun Linux JDK
1.3.1_8

Using Sun Linux JDK 1.2.2_016, however, I am still getting the following compile
error for OperationEnum:

compile.tests:
    [javac] Compiling 98 source files to
/home/phil/jakarta-commons/lang/target/tests
    [javac]
/home/phil/jakarta-commons/lang/src/test/org/apache/commons/lang/enum/OperationEnum.java:71:

be instantiated.
    [javac]         PLUS = new OperationEnum("Plus") {
    [javac]                ^
    [javac]

    [javac] Note: 7 files use or override a deprecated API.  Recompile with
"-deprecation" for details.
    [javac] 2 errors, 1 warning

I also had to add 

encoding="ISO-8859-1"

to the build.xml javac targets to get Entities, MethodUtils and
DurationFormatUtils to compile under 1.2.2_016.
, To clarify the comment above, all that is failing is compile.tests under Sun
Linux  JDK 1.2.2.  The compile target succeeds (i.e. src/java builds fine) and
the tests run clean using this JRE when compiled using 1.4., Stephen's change still fails to compile on my Linux JDK 1.2.2.

    [javac] /home/hen/jakarta/src/jakarta-
commons/lang/src/test/org/apache/commons/lang/enum/OperationEnum.java:71: 
class org.apache.commons.lang.enum.OperationEnum is an abstract class. It 
can't be instantiated.
    [javac]         PLUS = new OperationEnum("Plus") {

I haven't needed to use Phil's encoding attribute however to make the others 
compile., OK, I finally understand the problem.

static final OperationEnum PLUS = new OperationEnum("Plus") {
};
is defining a new anonymous class. However, because it is assigned to a static 
field and declared in a static context, the class must be a static nested class 
instead of an inner class. (inner classes reference their owning object, nested 
classes don't)

Obviously Sun improved the spec between 1.2 and 1.3 to allow for this unusual 
case by generating a nested class instead of an inner. 1.2 just objects that it 
can't create an inner class here.

So...we either find a way around the problem, or declare this particular piece 
of functionality broken if compiled using 1.2.

, Change made. It should work now on JDK1.2.
, Now works on JDK 1.2 on Linux. 1.3 had the same problem.]
