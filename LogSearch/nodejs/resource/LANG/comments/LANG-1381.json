[Different Handling seems to come from different result of isRegistered(value) in ToStringStyle.appendInternal().

isRegistered(value) checks for getRegistry().containsKey(value), which in case of empty HashMaps is true for any empty HashMap.

Consider also outputs for these cases:

 

    person.put({color:#008000}"a"{color}, {color:#008000}"b"{color});
    person.{color:#660e7a}job{color}.put({color:#008000}"a"{color}, {color:#008000}"b"{color});
    System.{color:#660e7a}out{color}.println(person); // job=Job@...
    person.clear();
    System.{color:#660e7a}out{color}.println(person); // job=Manager

 

At a glance, containsKey(value) might have to be replaced with identity check inside keySet(), Dear Mr. Kruse,

Thank you for taking this issue seriously! Also, thank you for the explanation. I was looking at the source code, but it didn't occur to me to look at the isRegistered method.
