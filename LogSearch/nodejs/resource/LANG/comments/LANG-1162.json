[The equals(...) method could check that the lengths are equal before calling regionMatches(...) as there is no point checking the contents if they differ.
This is already done by the related equalsIgnoreCase(...) method.

However the underlying method CharSequence.regionMatches(...) should ideally behave the same way as String.regionMatches(...), i.e. it should return false if the regions are different lengths., Fixed equals():
