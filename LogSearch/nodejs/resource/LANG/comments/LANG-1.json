Javadoc patch for lang
, Created an attachment (id=7848)
Fix typos patch
, I have applied all of the testing patch.

For the main patch, I have applied as much as I can. This includes everything 
except the builder package and StringUtils.

Unfortunately, the main patch was really too large, and contained too many 
changes. You have put a lot of work into the builder package, however I found 
some mistakes in the changes, and also a serious problem where a method was 
renamed. This shook my confidence in applying the patch.

I applied changes for CompareToBuilder manually, agreeing with some of your 
changes, disagreeing with others. This took about 2 hours for the one class, so 
I cannot procede to the others at present.

I don't want to dishearten you, as javadoc patches are very useful. For the 
future however I suggest contacting the mailing list first. I would also 
suggest separating javadoc fixes (eg.missing @param/@return) from javadoc text 
changes (better/different description) from javadoc style (html tags etc.). For 
me, each patch should take less than 30 mins (preferably 15mins) and be about 
one thing and one thing only.

thanks

, I understand your perspective and agree that it was too large.  I guess I was
trying to get it all in before 2.0, but perhaps that was optimistic.

I don't remember the instance of a changed method name.  But I do remember
running the lang tests numerous times and never got an failure.  Did I change
the test too?

As for the other minor errors, did the tests not cover them?

Anyway, lesson learned. I will be more proactive asking about things on the list
before making changes.

Thanks for looking at it!, The changed method name was in ToStringStyle (isShortClassName).

The 'other errors' referred to a couple of places in the new javadoc that 
didn't describe the classes functionality accurately. Can't remember where., Closed IIRC]
