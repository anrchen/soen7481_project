[I've uploaded a patch with a check that a constructor is either:
- For a normal, top-level class; or
- for an inner class that is a public, top-level class enclosed in a (set of) classes such that it is still visible.

For the visibility rule I have maintained the existing rule in ConstructorUtils that "visible" means "public". However, that is not quite correct in reality -- a constructor of an inner class can still be visible if it is contained within a class with default or protected visibility and the accessing code is in the right package. I'll leave the code this way as long as the Commons-Lang team does not decide to change the definition used., {quote}

although this is true, it is very unlikely to happen, since the calling code that does the reflection is in package {{org.apache.commons.lang3}}., Hello Ben,

I've reviewed your patch. Here are my findings:
* You're using tabs to indent your code. Please only use spaces, since the representation of tabs depends on your editor
* The tests are missing the {{@Test}} annotation
* The new files are missing the Apache License header

usually I would fix this myself and apply the patch, but the missing AL header is a problem. You either have to file an [Individual Contributor License Agreement|http://www.apache.org/licenses/] or reapply the patch with AL headers included. Sorry for the hassle but this is necessary to make sure we don't run into trouble regarding intellectual property.

Thanks for contributing,
Benedikt, [~bentels]: I can not apply your patch, without the ICLA, since I would have to modify your code. I'm only allowed to do this if you have the ICLA filled or if you resubmit a modified patch (ICLA would be better...).

TIA!, No response from OP; recoded without looking at the patch.
