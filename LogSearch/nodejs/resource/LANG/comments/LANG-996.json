[I'd like to have this fixed in 3.4, Looks like this will need a new version of the TextStrategy that supports case-blind matching.
This could perhaps be done by converting the month strings to lower case in the map; then converting the input value to lowercase before looking up the map.
The Locale is known when creating a Strategy, however it is not provided when parsing using the setCalendar method.
The Strategy interface is private, so it would be possible to change the setCalendar method to pass in the Locale., That's not sufficient - the generated regex also needs to be case-blind, commit 1589446, Thanks for the quick work guys, looking forward to using this in the next release. :-), hello guys, is there a snapshot jar where i can get this fix from, i have looked for it but couldnt find it., Snapshots are published to the ASF SNAPSHOT repository.

The URL is in the Apache Parent POM; just make sure you enable use of the repo "apache.snapshots.https"
