[Can you add some test with exact cases that reproduce the issue? I tried running sequences of append with null arguments and I always got a consistent with EqualsBuilder result. , I’m sorry, but this has been lost to time.  I can add that it was using the eclipse compiler for java 8 on a Mac.  

, Unfortunately I don't have any Mac machine available to test that. Please let me know if you find out some more info on this issue.

And if someone is able to test that on Mac with eclipse, I guess that would be great also.]
