, or on second thought, perhaps this fits better in [lang]?, Reassign to lang as it already has a BitSet class, changed summary title from [collections] to [lang], attaching new versions of
BitSetUtils and TestBitSetUtils in package org.apache.commons.lang with Apache
license version 2.0 and javadoc improvements., Created an attachment (id=10192)
updated BitSetUtils.java

, Sorry it's been so long, looking at as a part of releasing Lang 2.1. 

Negative view on this is that it really doesn't do much. Just a helper for a
couple of for loops. These methods are in themselves fine, but I don't think it
justifies adding a BitSetUtils.

Not too sure what Stephen meant by Lang has a BitSet below. It does have a
BitField, but I think that's a different concept to BitSet (pretty sure it is,
just don't recall why right now)., I concur that this doesn't seem that useful, nor good for lang inclusion. 
(Also, the proposed implementation is JDK1.4 specific) The main problem is that 
BitSet is not a class that is used to the same degree as Number , Boolean and 
String.]
