Patch to work around this issue

This patch works around spaces being between the '&' and the ';'.  To be more
correct, it should probably ensure that all characters between the '&' and ';'
are valid entity characters, but in most cases the offending character is a
space., Recreated issue with unit test. The proposed solution is too simple - we need to
be able to handle all situations, not just times when there is a space after the &. , Fixed by checking whether an & is closer than the subsequent ;. If so, then skip
onwards. Also a problem in unescapeXml.
