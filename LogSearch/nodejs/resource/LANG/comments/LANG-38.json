patch to StringUtils, StringUtilsTest
, Patch applied with changes. Thanks.

I decided not to use the StringUtils.indexOf etc functions.
I currently prefer each method doing its own stuff in StringUtils, to maximise 
performance. This could change in the future as an internal refactoring if 
someone performance tests the methods.
