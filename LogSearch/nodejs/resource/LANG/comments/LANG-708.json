[It seems that StringEscapeUtils.escapeJavaScript(value) from 2 commons.lang 2.1 does not have this problem with same string., Once you have created a JIRA issue, you can use More Actions / Attach Files to attach files.

Please could you do so with the test data? It's difficult to use as it is.

The issue text could then be editted to remove the inline data.

Thanks very much., drop both files to same dir and run Test.java as main class - it would print result of conversion with 3.0 and 2.1 to system out - 3.0 will have described problem, 2.1 will not (both libs should be added as project deps)., With LANG-720 fixed, lang3 trunk no longer cuts off the end of the string., Setting fix version to 3.0.1.

Setting resolution to Fixed; I think we should treat this as a different bug entry to LANG-720, even if the same code change fixed it. It's a notably different symptom and worth calling out.]
