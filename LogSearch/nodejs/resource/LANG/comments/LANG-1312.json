    Yesterday learned something new about `String.format` via pull request #238, and now learning about [UN M.49](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_M.49). Thanks again @PascalSchumacher :-)
    
    Code and test look good, checked out locally, all tests passing. +1

    @kinow: Thanks for the review. :-)
    
    I also did not know about UN M.49 till yesterday. I just stumbled over this while analyzing commons-lang test failures on java 9 for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LANG-1265
