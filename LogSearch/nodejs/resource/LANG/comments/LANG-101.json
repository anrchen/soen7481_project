[It requires test cases, and better methods that allow the format to be 
controlled. All help will be welcomed ;-), making it public shouldn't require test cases and any other functionality than 
it already has. If you make it public it will lead to more help because more 
people will use it. As it is now it shouldn't even be shipped with the jar., Having high test coverage is an important target for Lang, so things do not get
released (read made public) without being covered somewhat.

However, is planned for this to be on the next release, and marking this as a
dupe of #15082.
