[In fact all the local links under Commons and General Information are broken.

That's probably because the Lang URL was incorrect when the site was generated.
The URL has since been corrected, but the site has not been re-released., I have noticed that page http://projects.apache.org/projects/commons_lang.html says "Releases can be downloaded from http://commons.apache.org/downloads/download_lang.cgi".  But that URL gives a 403 Forbidden error.
The correct URL seems to be http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-lang/download_lang.cgi, Thanks for the report.
Several other DOAPS used the wrong URL, fixed in SVN (will be picked up in a few hours when projects is rebuilt):

URL: http://svn.apache.org/r1484266

I've cleared browser cache.  This appears to have not been fully resolved., Agreed; I only fixed the DOAP problem reported by Peter Ford., Fixed. Apologies for the slowness :(]
