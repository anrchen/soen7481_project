[The latter seems to make the most sense - the Rule objects are a tokenized version of the mPattern String, and that is going to be happily serialized.

mRules and mMaxLengthEstimate have been made transient as the init() method sets both of them up.

The deserialize method is:

+    // Serializing
+    //-----------------------------------------------------------------------
+    private void readObject(ObjectInputStream in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
+        in.defaultReadObject();
+        init();
+    }
