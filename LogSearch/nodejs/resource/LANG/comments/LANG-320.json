[Might want to consider guarding such tests where expected results are vendor-specific (potentially LANG-318 as well, though haven't looked at that closely) based on the vendor information. [lang] itself provides SystemUtils.JAVA_VENDOR etc. to make the information trivially accessible.
, This test in special has not to do much with the vendor. Sun might deliver the cy_GB local with every new patch and then the test will fails also. LANG-318 is different though., Should be fixed. We had the same problem with US_en when US_es turned up (or something like that). The solution then was to change the test to not use one with a dupe. Maybe we need a better test instead. Investigate for 3.0., I've fixed this by changing both of the assertions to only assert that the results contain, rather than that the results equal. This should allow things to be less problematic when a JVM adds a language, and it seems a lot less likely that the JVM would remove a language.

Fixed in r508733.]
