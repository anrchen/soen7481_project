    [LANG-1314] Fix javadoc creation on with Java 8

    Java 8's javadoc seems to be stricter than Java 7's, and the current head current fails to generate javadoc (`mvn javadoc:javadoc`) with Java 8.
    
    This PR contains a series of fixes to the various classes' javadoc which are required for Java 8 (but would also improve the javadoc generated with earlier java versions) and then adds the `javadoc:javadoc` target to Travis CI so we can guarantee it won't break again.

    Fix StirngUtils </p> tags in javadoc
    
    The paragraph
    
    </p>Whitespace is defined by {@link Character#isWhitespace(char)}.</p>
    
    appears in several places in the javadoc (presumably, copy-pasted from
    the original one to the others). This is obviously a mistake, as a
    paragraph should start with <p>, not with </p>.
    
    This patch fixes all the occurrences of this paragraph to the proper
    form:
    
    <p>Whitespace is defined by {@link Character#isWhitespace(char)}.</p>

    Remove </p> tag from Computable's javadoc
    
    The standard javadoc doclet does not allow self closing tags (such as
    </p>). This patch removes such a tag from Computable's javadoc, as it's
    redundant anyway, as it's only used to create spaces between two
    existing paragraphs.

    @mureinik Sorry it wasn't my intention to steal the authorship of your commits with the javadoc fixes. :( I wasn't aware that a `git rebase` changes the author.

    @PascalSchumacher no harm done. I'd rather have commons-lang's javadoc build properly than one patch more or less to my so-called name.
