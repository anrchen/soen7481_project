[Hello again Haiyang! Nice catch. It was working as expecting due to {{Array.newInstance}} taking care of creating new arrays with the correct type. Furthermore, the {{public static <T> T[] add(final T[] array, final int index, final T element)}} method uses {{.getComponentType()}} as you suggested too.

Tested locally and all tests passed. 

Thank you!
