[Shouldn't the unescape also handle percent sign prefixed hex values like %20 ?, Created an attachment (id=9887)
added handling for '%xx' escapes and fixed bug for '&#x' escapes
, Is the %nn format part of the HTML spec? 

I know &#x and &#X are: http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/charset.html#h-5.3.1
, In the future, please use the patch format so we can see what the changes are:
http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/patches.html. Thanks., The '%nn' encoding is for encoding URLs/URIs and not for encoding HTML., I've fixed "&#xN;" and "&#XN;" in CVS. The "%nn" format is out of the scope of
this API. A unit tests has been added. Please check it out and confirm that this
addresses your issue. Thanks!, According to the comments in this, this is done. Considering it fixed., 2.1 released, closing.]
