[Once commons-lang requires at least java 7 we can use @SafeVarargs, but for now I guess there is nothing we can do., We could start adding comments to state why the warning is not a problem (if indeed that is the case).
This means analysing the true cause of the warning, which will have to be done at some point anyway.

This would at least indicate to developers/maintainers/3rd parties that the warning has been taken into acount.

It's obviously important not to suppress the warning without first ensuring that the code is safe., +1 [~sebb@apache.org] for adding comments now in the code. Never used @SafeVarargs, but sounds like a good plan when we have >java 7 [~pascalschumacher]]
