[Patches welcome, It looks like 'X' has been added to master: https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=commons-lang.git;a=blob;f=src/main/java/org/apache/commons/lang3/time/FastDateParser.java;h=8275ddfd2b5eade34a4a19048c1b0b869d8f1eda;hb=refs/heads/master#l600., [~hyukjin.kwon] which constructor are you using for FastDateFormat? There is no constructor using only a single String parameter., Oh, I am so sorry. I use {{FastDateFormat.getInstance("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSXXX")}}. It wrote this wrong during testing between {{SimpleDateFormat}} and {{FastDateFormat}}., This works with the current code base. See  commit bdb074610c87a210ea4c0d91d579cb4558f4b19f, Thank you for your help.]
