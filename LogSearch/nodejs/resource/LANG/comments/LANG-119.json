[In CVS and nightly-builds you will find isEquals() public and setEquals() protected., I created a subclass of EqualsBuilder without a problem.  You only need to
change isEquals if you've found an inequality, right?  So instead of setting it
directly, just call append(true, false) and put in a comment explaining why
you're doing that.

, In CVS, so fixed., 2.1 released, closing.]
