[Patches welcome! Don't forget to include a junit test :-), Commit cb83f7cb31e50f265e098c5380b3f0051e257f46 has a test to show that this is same behavior as SimpleDateFormat., Thanks for commit tests.
I agree that is same behavior as SimpleDateFormat.
However, It is incorrect operation, I think.

format : yyyyMMdd
input : 20150429113100

It matches pattern below
{code}(\p{Nd{4}}+)(\p{Nd{2}+)(\p{Nd}++){code}
It works yyyy, MM, and the others are dd (don't care how long digits)

Is there any plan for patches, or not?, [~freeism], no I don't think so, because FastDateFormat is supposed to be a replacement for SimpleDateFormat, so it has to behave the same way., Ok, Thank you for reply. Have a nice day :)]
