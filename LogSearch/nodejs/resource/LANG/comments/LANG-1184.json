    Noting that the javadoc doesn't indicate that nbsp is escaped. I'm +1 to also escaping nbsp, but javadoc should be updated.

    Made a couple of notes, one on code that can be removed and one on documentation; but looks good to me otherwise.

    Thank you for your interest in [lang].
    
    Java says a non-breaking whitespace is not a whitespace:
    
    ```java
    Character.isWhitespace('\u00A0'));
    ```
    
    returns `false`.
    
    So I am not sure this patch is valid.

    Given one of the behaviours of nbsp is not to collapse down, there is a logic in normalizeWhitespace not normalizing the nbsp characters.

    @garydgregory @hen Thanks for the reviews. :)
    
    As mentioned in the jira issue the goal of this pull request is not to add anything, but to restore pre-3.4 functionality: 
    
    These work with 3.3.2, but fail with 3.4:
    
    ```java
    assertEquals("a b", StringUtils.normalizeSpace("a\u00A0 b"));
    assertEquals("b", StringUtils.normalizeSpace("b\u0000"));
    ```
    
    while keeping in place most of the performance improvement added in https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/commit/bc8e23808b9d8d0c9b67270ef35d04ebd9d89cc8 
    
    I used same tests https://github.com/librucha/commons-lang-normalizespaces-benchmark and there is only a 10% performance regression for the restored pre-3.4 behavior (the trimming of the string and the normalization of non-braking spaces).

    @hen  Thanks again for the in-depth review.
    
    Part of the is `isEmpty()` is necessary, because `normalizeSpace` has to return `null` for `null` parameters according to javadoc `@return the modified string with whitespace normalized, {@code null} if null String input`
    
    I have updated the pull request and replaced the is `isEmpty()` check by `str == null`.
    
    I have also updated javadoc to reflect that non-breaking space is normalized.

    Hi All,
    
    I'm more concerned about what the proper behavior of the method is, rather than its behavior in some past arbitrary version. Since Java does not define a nbsp as a whitespace, it should not be normalized away IMO. Now, if you want it normalized, we could talk about adding another method or documenting how to deal with this special use case. 
    
    Are there other characters that are ws-like characters that return false for Character.isWhitespace(). Unicode is pretty rich, maybe there is more. What would this new method be called?

    Hi Gary,
    
    3.0 had the same behavior as 3.3.2, but I guess this is not a productive discussion.
    
    I know that `Character.isWhitespace` defines `\u00A0` as not a white space, but for example guava https://github.com/google/guava/blob/8fbeb9038cbe8b382b1ee188ae8459203cd04fb5/guava/src/com/google/common/base/CharMatcher.java#L1217 classifies it as whitespace.
    
    If you want to keep the changed behavior I suggest at least to re-add the `trim()` call or to remove the `Additionally <code>{@link #trim(String)}</code> removes control characters (char &lt;= 32) from both ends of this String.` part of the java doc.
    
    I'm not unicode expert, but https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space has a list of some more non-breaking-space unicode characters.
    
    As for the method name I guess the easy way out would be to add a flag to normalize space. I can not come up with a good method name at the moment `normalizeAllSpace`, is my best try.

    Hi all,
    
    an comments?
, I the "non-trimming" part of the issue and created an new issue for it [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LANG-1226]., Github user garydgregory commented on the pull request:

    https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/pull/113#issuecomment-217737900
  
    Yes, let's add a new method.
, Github user PascalSchumacher commented on the issue:

    https://github.com/apache/commons-lang/pull/184
  
    @phoenix384 The problem is that starting with 3.4 StringUtils#normalizeSpace no longer normalizes unicode non-breaking spaces. I reported this as a bug and argued for reverting this behavior, but other people disagreed. :(
