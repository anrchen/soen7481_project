[Patch is on it's way, Added code for correct rounding based on AM_PM and repaired the JUnit-tests (and their comments), Patch applied, thanks Robert., I've started writing new DateUtils-tests according to [LANG-443]. And now it seems AM_PM is still not rounded in the correct way. 
It's switch-point is between 06:59.999 and 07:00.000, which is exactly one hour too late. The tests provided didn't cover these times. Another reason for better tests.
, AM_PM "one off"-fix, svn ci -m "Applying Robert Scholte's excellent unit tests from LANG-443 and his second patch from LANG-440 fixing a discovered boundary case for AM_PM in round"
