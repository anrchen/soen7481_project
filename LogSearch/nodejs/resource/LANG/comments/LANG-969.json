[Looks like a bug, probably a cut and paste error. This should be fixed in 4.0 since we cannot break binary compatibility., I don't think Exceptions are part of the method signature.

AFAIK, this would only break source compatibility, Clirr does not complain, so it is OK to break source compatibility for 3.3?, I would say breaking source compatibility is OK, provided that this is clearly documented in the release notes.

It's not a big deal to fix the source., Thank you for the report Matt, good catch!

, bq. I would say breaking source compatibility is OK, provided that this is clearly documented in the release notes.

Do you have an idea where we can put a reminder to add this to the release notes? I'm afraid that we forget this when we roll out the release., The changes.xml doc has a description section., Okay, so we don't need additional prose like we had for for 3.2.]
