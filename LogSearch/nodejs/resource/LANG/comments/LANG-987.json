[This is definitely a bug and it was introduced during the fix for LANG-951. There are many unit tests covering the method, but for some reason none that use {{DateUtils.getFragmentInDays(<foo>, Calendar.MONTH)}}.

, Sorry for my tough tone, but this did impact a lot on my system, pls fix this ASAP, thx~, Patches are always welcome :-), Found time to take a look at this. Added missing unit tests, so we shouldn't lose this functionality again.
