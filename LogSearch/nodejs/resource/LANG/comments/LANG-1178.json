, Pull request merged. Thanks!

This issue can be resolved., You should assign to yourself and set a fix version., I would if I could, but as I'm not commons-lang committer I do not have the necessary permissions. (I just used the apache wide commit access to commons-lang to merge the pull request.), Merged by [~pascalschumacher], thanks.]
