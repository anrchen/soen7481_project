cvs [log aborted]: Can't parse date/time: 23:50 EST

However, if parseCVS can handle it, current System date seems to make the most
sense. 

Nice comment for parseCVS:

    // TODO: Decide whether this code is removed or goes into 2.1

If it used current System date, it would have to make sure it didn't get 24
hours off due to timezone confusion., Since cvs doesn't parse just a time, maybe parseCVS should behave the same way., The method needs further development. It has been moved into the DateFormatter
class in the lang sandbox. Accompanying test (testParseCVS) has been moved to
DateformatterTest.java in the lang sandbox.]
