\section{Conclusion}

Our work justifies the helpfulness of user-reported logs and provides an approach that fully utilizes these logsto perform static analysis. Although a huge part of RQ1 is still in progress, we have high expectations in our methodology. We can see our tool to be complementary to many of state-of-the-art log analysis tools, such as Loggly or Logstash. In RQ2 of our study, our findings highlight general guideline that can be useful to testing improvement. We hope the open research findings can inspire other researchers into futher investigation. The idea of test and production failure mapping is novel, even promising if we look at the overlaps that exist between the test and exception stack trace.
